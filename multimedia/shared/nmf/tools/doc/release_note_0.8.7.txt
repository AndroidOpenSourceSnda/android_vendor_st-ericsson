**********************************************************
* Nomadik Multiprocessing Framework (version 0.8.7)      *
**********************************************************

The release comprises one .tgz file holding the following features:
	- Component manager binary & api
 	- Synchronous & Hybrid execution engine binaries
 	- Component tool chain binary
 	- Example source codes (Hello World's, Training, Mandelbrot, User Fifo)
 	- Documentations (User guide, programming model, CM API, MPC API)
 		User guide not fully in line with delivery
 
Sources are delivered in another .tgz.

Supported target:
	- STn8815 SAA & SVA Cut A0/B0

Changes:
--------
[CM]
	- Add monitoring API accessible from Host with CM API (see documentation).
		Add new method in CM Public API
	- Update OSAL in order to be able to disable interruption or lock scheduler.
	- Remove hardware semaphore usage for communication mutual exclusion 
	  * Change made for reliability & deadlock reasons
	  * Keep hardware semaphore usage for core synchronization (for interrupt)
	  * Remove power of two constraints alignment done internally but one more element allocate for
		fifo management 
	- Add CM_StartComponent() and CM_StopComponent() in order to change component state.
	  * CM_StartComponent() check that all required interface have been bind.
	  * CM_Bindxxx() and CM_Unbindxxx() can be called only if component stopped.
	  * Component call from Host allowed only if component started.
	  * CM_DestroyInstance() can't be called until component stopped and all interface unbinded.
	- Add Unbinded method that call Panic if called (useful for trap call to unbind required interface)
	- Rename CM_DestroyInstance by CM_DestroyComponent (old method deprecated since long time)
		Signature not changed (you could use replace in your code)
	- Error CM_COMPONENT_NOT_INITIALIZED replace by CM_COMPONENT_WAIT_STOPPED
	- For allowing debugger to implement deferred breakpoint, always call executive engine
	  Constructor & Destroyer runners of corresponding life cycle methods. 
	  If not provided by component, call Void method instead.
	- NMF_ASSERT internal macro now log assert and block infinitely.
	- Update CM_getPanicDescription API in order to return information about MPC Panic.
	  OS integrator can now call arbitrary panic callback.
	
[MPC Executive Engine]
	- Update scheduler in order to support monitoring based on timer0
	- Special compilation option for Panic compilation in order to force MMDSP compiler to don't 
	  make wrong optimization and removing infinite loop (such option will be removed when bug 
	  fixed in MMDSP compiler).
	- PRIVATE macro will not be defined as static
	
[Execution Environment]
	- Hack bare environment swi handler to add Enable/Disable of interrupt
	- Add os21 environment
	- NMF_INSTALL_ROOT environment variable must be defined where delivery unpacked.
	  (this variable will be set by Nomadik Toolset).
	- #include <cm/engine/inc/cm_irq.h> must be used for call CM in interrupt handler.	
	- STn8810 support removed from delivery
	- Update environment in order to allow user to register an MPC Panic callback by setting
	  cte_PanicCallBack variable to it's own callback method. 
	  
[Tools] 
	- Update generated elfheader section binary format (need Toolset recompilation)
	  * Add magic number for singleton (no structure modification)
	  * Change Life Cycle functions management in t_elf_component_header
	  * Add minStackSize
	- Allow parallel compilation for RVCT, GCC and MMDSP target 
		(Maximum jobs is fixed to 1, used -j <jobs> or NMF_JOBS to set more)
	- Generate life cycle method for calling each sub-component life cycle method in 
	  composite component. 

[Programming model]
	- "static" component keyword replace by "singleton" one in order to prepare next step
	  Either primitive or composite component could be declared as singleton.
	  (See NMF programming model documentation for more information).
	- Add life cycle management and associated interface in order to react on status change:
	  * lifecycle.constructor: called when component instantiated (CM_InstantiateComponent)
	  * lifecycle.starter: called when component started (CM_StartComponent)
	  * lifecycle.stopper: call when component stopped (CM_StartComponent)
	  * lifecycle.destructor: call when component destroyed (CM_DestroyComponent)
	- Enhance ADL parser for recognize hexa and octal integer.
	  For attributes, options, collection indexes and sizes, ... 
	- Enhance ADL parser for recognize char value.

Bug fixes:
----------
 - Memory crash in MMDSP segment loader. 
 - [ Defect #22702 ] [Tools] pointer to typedef should be allowed in an interface
 - [ Defect #25790 ] [Doc]user-guide example step0 is not maintained
   [ Defect #28581 ] [Examples] can no longer compile user-guide examples
 	User guide examples no more available (user guide document will change)
 - [ Defect #28454 ] [CM] erroneous memory status after CM_AddSdramMemorySegment
 - [ Defect #28480 ] [CM] CM_ILLEGAL_UNBINDING after unbinding of component binded to void
	Done, use CM_UnbindComponent.
 - [ Defect #28656 ] [CM] possibility to do multiple bindings on the same interfaces
 	Error CM_INTERFACE_ALREADY_BINDED returned.
	Binding must be unbinded before rebind.
 - [ Defect #30097 ] [CM] return values of Fifo Management API
 	Code now check if fifoid is invalid and return CM_UNKNOWN_FIFO_ID in that case
 - [ Defect #31256 ] [CM] no error when binding an itf already bound
 	CM_INTERFACE_ALREADY_BINDED error will be return now.
 - [ Defect #31658 ] [CM] on bare machine it is not possible to call an interface from a dsp 
   to host callback
	Fixed by disabling IT on bare machine when entering CM.
	Nevertheless, to do that we must dynamically patch APD services layer which run in user more and is not designed to do such think.
 - [ Defect #31714 ] [CM] overalignment for mpc memories ESRAM16/SDRAM16
 	due to fact that one 16 bits mmdsp word is equivalent to two bytes and not 4.
	Reduce internal alignement constraints in dsp.c in case of external 16 bits mode.
 - [ Defect #31956 ] [CM] : user fifo : ee not load during CM_CreateUserFifo if needed
 	In CM_CreateUserFifo() insure mpc is well started and that ee has been load
 - [ Defect #31968 ] [CM] : userfifo : possible memory leak when CM_CreateUserFifo() failed
 	Add delete of already allocated fifo or component in case of error
 - [ Defect #32440 ] [CM] CM_GetMpcMemoryStatus crashes after particular r/w operations
 	Crash was due to a test problem. Msg buffer too small
 - [ Defect #32550 ] [Tools] hexadecimal attribute value is not accepted
	Done for every integer allowed in ADL (including collection index and size).
 - [ Defect #32554 ] [Tools] initial value in .conf for char attribute
 	Done. Nevertheless char is not integer and you can assign hexa to char.
	But you can do:
		attributes char attr_a='A'
		attributes char attr_c='\035'
	If you want 1 byte integer you sould use t_uint8.
 - [ Defect #32638 ] [CM] Composite with a bind between a sub-component required interface 
 	and a composite required interface using collection index
 	Corrected. The problem occure when binding an interface required by a composite and when 
 	this interface was not bind internally. Nevertheless, since it's allowed by programming model, 
 	this issue was fixed in CM which now allow composite required interface to have no internal client.
 - [ Defect #32641 ] [TOOLS] Configured limit insufficient for the allowed tests in a test class
 - [ Defect #32651 ] [CM] hardware semaphore blocked after multiple NMFCALL
 - [ Defect #32769 ] [Tools] 'private' macro ignored in composite
 	PRIVATE will be define as static now.
	#define PRIVATE static
 - [ Defect #32850 ] [CM] NMF_ASSERT triggered if doing a great deal of CM_InstantiateComponent
 - [ Defect #32937 ] t_uint16 incorrectly passed in interfaces from host to mpc
	 We assume that MMDSP by make sign extension.
	Thus, defect solved by adding mask in unsigned integer.
 - [ Defect #33194 ] [CM] CM_AllocMpcMemory and CM_GetMpcMemoryStatus do not distinguish XMEM from YMEM
 	TCM size for x a and y partition was wrong
 - [ Defect #33229 ] unconsistant trace message when unbinding asynchronous
 - [ Defect #33236 ] unexpected error when unbinding to void
 	Done, no error returned now.
 - [ Defect #33363 ] [Doc] CM_INVALID_PARAMETER return code for Binding functions not documented in cm_api doc
 - [ Defect #33475 ] [CM] Callback function needed for the Panic test class non-regression testing
 	Update environment in order to allow user to register an MPC Panic callback by setting cte_PanicCallBack 
 	variable to it's own callback method.
	Add this code in your test :
		#include <nmf_cte/configuration/api/panic.h>
		....
		void myPanic(
		t_nmf_core_id coreId,
		t_panic_reason panicReason,
		t_cm_instance_handle faultingComponent,
		t_uint32 panicInfo1,
		t_uint32 panicInfo2) {
		}
		...
		cte_PanicCallBack = myPanic;
 - [ Defect #33494 ] [CM] Behavior with USER_PANIC and INTERNAL_PANIC reason not consistents
 	This is the normal behavior USER_PANIC is considered as light Panic and INTERNAL_PANIC as hard panic.
 	Thus in the first one we abort current execution and switch to next one, the second stop the MPC.
 - [ Defect #33546 ] [CM] 'optional' required interface and CM_StartComponent
 - [ Defect #33553 ] [CM] Network instropection fct. CM_GetComponentListHeader incorrect behavior
 	Destroy component are now filtered


Notes:
------
    - Communication scheme uses active polling when overflow on communication fifos
			Active polling will be removed in next delivery

	- Synchronous & Hybrid execution engines
		Priority mechanism not fully tested 
	- Inter-MPC distribution not supported due to hardware limitation on STn8815A0
	- No cross calling between ESRAM and SDRAM Code
		A component code must fit in one memory segment only
		
	- MP3 example supported only on nmf_bare environment (not included in Nomadik Toolset delivery).
		This example reuse CSD algorithm and must not been distribute outside ST Microelectronics.
		Today, this example only runs on bare machine (due to APD HCL/Services packages issues).
