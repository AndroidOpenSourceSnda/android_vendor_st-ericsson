KNOWN ISSUES
------------
Following is a list of known issues 

* In case the remote connection port has been changed the restart of the 
application is needed!  
* During development we have met unstable behaviour of Libusb under
Windows for communication of multiple USB devices. This problem made us
to implement minor fixes in windows.c file. The changed code is
distributed under the same license as the original one, LGPL v. 2.1.
We expect that a new version of Libusb for Windows will appear which
would solve this issue. When it happens, the library changed by us will
be replaced by the newer version.
