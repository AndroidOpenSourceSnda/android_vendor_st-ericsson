There are three ways to set the debug level within simd.

1. On the command line, by specifying -v through to -vvvv
On the host, this is normally achieved using say ./simd -vvvv
On the target, this is normally set by editing the init.rc file.
Note that simd and modem have the same level using this mechanism.

2. By configuration file on the target, to assist with tracing startup issues.
For example, from the console shell prompt, enter commands such as

# echo 3 > /etc/simd_debug_level.ini
# echo 3 > /etc/modem_debug_level.ini
To restore the default level, remove the configuration file.
Note: Only the first character is read, and it should be 0, 1, 2 or 3.
Note: This method is NOT supported on the host.

3. By using tuicc commands.
# tuicc -i setSimDebugLevel
# tuicc -i setModemDebugLevel
Each prompts for an integer in the range 0 to 3.

The default level for both sub-systems without any configuration
option is to display only errors.
