3.1 Component Manager

    - Fix issue in singleton management
	-> Optional interface is managed like other one and since singleton is immutable, 
	   it must be fully unbinded before bind rebinded (only regarding required interface).
	       Note: This assumption is too high and break dma implementation which is singleton
	       Thus: fix in CM to allow physical unbind of singleton when required !!!!
