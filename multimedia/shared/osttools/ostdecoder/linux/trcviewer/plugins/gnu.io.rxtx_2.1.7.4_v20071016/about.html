<h2>About This Content</h2>

This is an unmodified binary release of RXTX-2.1-7r2 as downloaded
from <a href="http://www.rxtx.org">http://www.rxtx.org</a>, with 
the following exceptions:
<ul>
  <li>RXTXCommDriver.java v1.16.2.57 was compiled from RXTX CVS and included 
      in order to support disabling version print on startup (set System Property
      <tt>-Dgnu.io.rxtx.NoVersionOutput=true</tt>). This is RXTX 
      <a href="http://bugzilla.qbang.org/show_bug.cgi?id=71">bug 71</a>.</li>
  <li>CommPortIdentifier.java: Include the Fix for RXTX
      <a href="http://bugzilla.qbang.org/show_bug.cgi?id=83">bug 83</a>
      due to which CommPortOwnership events are lost. The original 
      fix from bugzilla is included in this version of the library.</li>
  <li>Linux native library was built without lockfiles (contrary to
      the original distribution) in order to allow easier use. See 
      the file BUILD_INFO.txt in <tt>gnu.io.rxtx.linux.x86</tt> and
      <tt>gnu.io.rxtx.linux.x86_64</tt> for details.</li>
  <li>Solaris native library was linked statically in order to avoid
      dependency on libgcc_s (RXTX 
      <a href="http://bugzilla.qbang.org/show_bug.cgi?id=73">bug 73</a>).
      See the file BUILD_INFO.txt in <tt>gnu.io.rxtx.solaris.sparc</tt>
      for details.</li>

An executable that contains no derivative of any portion of RXTX, but
is designed to work with RXTX by being dynamically linked with it,
is considered a "work that uses the Library" subject to the terms and
conditions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The following has been added to the RXTX License to remove
any confusion about linking to RXTX.   We want to allow in part what
section 5, paragraph 2 of the LGPL does not permit in the special
case of linking over a controlled interface.  The intent is to add a
Java Specification Request or standards body defined interface in the 
future as another exception but one is not currently available.

As a special exception, the copyright holders of RXTX give you
permission to link RXTX with independent modules that communicate with
RXTX solely through the Sun Microsytems CommAPI interface version 2,
regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy
and distribute the resulting combined work under terms of your choice,
provided that every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a complete
copy of the source code of RXTX (the version of RXTX used to produce the
combined work), being distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General
Public License plus this exception.  An independent module is a
module which is not derived from or based on RXTX.

Note that people who make modified versions of RXTX are not obligated
to grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is
their choice whether to do so.  The GNU Lesser General Public License
gives permission to release a modified version without this exception; this
exception also makes it possible to release a modified version which
carries forward this exception.
