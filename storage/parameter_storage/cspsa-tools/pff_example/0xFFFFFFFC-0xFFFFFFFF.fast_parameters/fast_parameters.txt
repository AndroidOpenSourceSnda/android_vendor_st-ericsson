There are currently four items treated specially as "fast parameters". These four
keys reside from 0xFFFFFFFC to 0xFFFFFFFF. They are all 4 bytes long, and cannot
be deleted. Their default value is 0x00000000.

They are "fast parameters" as they are not stored in the data area of CSPSA, but
in the header. So to read out these values one only needs to read the CSPSA header.
