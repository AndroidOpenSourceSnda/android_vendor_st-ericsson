Changes:
--------
[NMF Think]
    - All peripheral clocks are activated. In case board is flash then some clocks were not
      active and so some think driver were not started. Note that this is a temporary hack
      since think drivers are supposed to activate their clocks/power through think power
      driver.
    - Add mop500_ed-think support. Note the following about clock and reset for this delivery :
        - Pll management and clock divider settings are the responsability of debugger script.
        - Think will release reset of peripherals.
        - Think will set peripherals clock enable for all peripheral control by PRCCs units.
