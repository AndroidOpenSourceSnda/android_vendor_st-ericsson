3.1 Component Manager

3.2 MPC Execution Engine

3.3 Host Execution Engine

	- Enable EE_DRV_TrigInterrupt in order to send virtual interrupt from kernel side to Host EE
		-> In order to catch them, you have to declare an exception.handler interface in your component
			provides exception.handler as myhandler interrupt X
		-> Thus, you can trig them
			EE_DRV_TrigInterrupt(X)
		Note, the registering and unregistering of your handler are automatically done when
		loading and unloading component
		.
        
3.4 OS integration guidelines

	- EE_DRV_TrigInterrupt API fully implemented, check chain !!
		This API is in the ee/drv/api path, nevertheless, must be integrated in the CM driver for now.
		Maybe FairBank will require to split it in order to be used without CM.


3.5 Tools

3.6 Programming model

3.7 Think


    -  Variable cfgComponentRepositoryPath must be declared in user code in order to set 
	   NMF CM component repository path.
 	   Component repository path is directory separate by ";".
		
		char   cfgComponentRepositoryPath[] = "Path1;Path2;Path3";
	
	-  Add weak symbol __think_trace__modem_mipi34_on to control if ape or modem output trace on
	   mipi34 connector.
    
    -  Don't stop sia/sva 90Khz timers if they were started
    
    -  At boot disable irq/fiq for both core. This avoid that later on core1 service in interrupt with
       cache disable that can cause random behaviours.

5   COMPILATION RULES

5.1 Compilation procedure & options

    Compilation options is fully based on MMENV.
    

5.2 Compilation configurability

    EXPORT_SHARED: can be re-defined for exporting API in a specific manner
    IMPORT_SHARED: can be re-defined for importing API in a specific manner
    
    For Think dynamic configuration, see doxygen documentation (think/doc/nmfthink/index.html).

    
5.3 Installation

    Please define components.txt using RODOS.

6.3 Symbian Creasy scheduler check (valid until dual core ED mode supported)

    Done.

6.4 Confidentiality safe

	Done.
