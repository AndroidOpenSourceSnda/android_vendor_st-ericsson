WARNING !!!
===========
Only meaningful chapters for single component delivery are described herebelow.
If chapter is not described, it means you need to refer to the associated Domain Delivery Release note


3	RELEASE CONTENT
3.1	Released Features :
		- Contains software and hardware encoder components.

3.2	New features:
		* Support for ARM load computation added.
		* Support for RME added.
		* Support added for OST Traces.
		* Support for H263 profile 3 in SW encoder.
				
3.3	Modified features:
		* Changes done in calculation of Qp values for CBR/VBR cases.
		* Updated the parsing done in ProcessingComponent of ExtraData sections, now it does not assume the first extra data to be stab extra data.
		* Updated Ddep to raise EOS buffer flag event AFTER the buffers are released
		* If a Pause command comes during encoding, the command is held until endAlgo is called for that frame.
		* All internal and input/output buffers are now made cacheable for SW encoder.
		
3.4	Removed features:
		NA

3.5	Restrictions / Known issues:
		* Cropping testcases are not working on V1 board (Fw-VI 26356)
		* Data partitioning cases are crashing (getting fillLen morethan allocLen) (Fw-VI 26971, Osi-VI 25289)
		* Some streams are not bit matching in CBR/VBR cases (VI 26974).
	Resolved in this release:
		* VI 32019 (Parameters sent to algo should take into account nFirstGOB field of OMX_VIDEO_PARAM_VIDEOFASTUPDATETYPE)
		* VI 32167 ([ncp110]: Static parameter setting on disabled port reports error for MPEG4 OMX Encoder component)
		* VI 32168 ([ncp110]MPEG4 encoder does not behave correctly with OMX_IndexParamVideoProfileLevelQuerySupported setting)
		* Corrected the debug buffer size sent to mpc_trace_init in Ddep.
		* Now correct value of eColorFormat returned when using OMX_IndexParamVideoPortFormat (ER 317856)
		* ER 318345: Correction in allocation of mvfieldbuffer

3.6 Sanity Report:
		* Failing Testcases
			- dual_mpeg4_encode_14_01, Test crashes due to issues identified in Validation Test Suite
			- dual_mpeg4_encode_14_03, Test crashes due to issues identified in Validation Test Suite
			- generic_mpeg4_encode_07_19, (Osi-VI 26974)
			- generic_mpeg4_encode_07_21, (Osi-VI 26974)
			- generic_mpeg4_encode_08_31, (Osi-VI 26974)
			- generic_mpeg4_encode_09_12, (Fw-VI 26971, Osi-VI 25289)
			- generic_mpeg4_encode_09_19, (Fw-VI 26971, Osi-VI 25289)
			- mpeg4_encode_cropping_03_20 (Fw-VI 26356)
			- mpeg4_encode_cropping_03_64 (Fw-VI 26356)
			- mpeg4_encoder_tunnel_06_05, validation test suite is not setting timestamps and hence bitexactness is not achevied.
			- mpeg4_encoder_tunnel_06_08, validation test suite is not setting timestamps and hence bitexactness is not achevied.
			- mpeg4_encoder_port_test_51_06, test case hangs (to be analyzed)
			- mpeg4_encoder_flush_54_08, test case hangs (to be analyzed)
			- mpeg4_encoder_dynamic_55_05, (OSI_VAL-VI 27914)
