*****************************
* Nomadik Kernel 0.6.0 (M1) *
*****************************

The release comprises one .tgz file holding the following features:
	- Component manager binary & api
 	- Synchronous & Hybrid execution engine binaries
 	- Component tool chain binary
 	- Example source codes (Hello World, User Guide, MP3, User Fifo)
 	- Documentations (User guide, programming model, CM API, DSP API)

Supported target:
	- STn8815 SAA & SVA

Changes:
--------
Not relevant

Bug fixes:
----------
Not relevant

Notes:
------
	- MMDSP debugger not component aware in MMDSP toolset 3.0.1

	- Synchronous & Hybrid execution engines
		Priority mechanism not fully tested and allowed only in composite 
		component not though Component manager API (will be available in M2 Milestone)
	- Inter-DSP distribution not supported due to hardware limitation
		Will be fixed in STn8815B0
	- Only the 24bits mode supported on DSP
	- No cross calling between ESRAM and SDRAM Code
		A component code must fit in one segment only
		
	- Unbind and destroy component not fully implemented (unsafe reconfiguration)
		Safe reconfiguration will be available in M2 Milestone
	- Memory allocator don't manage alignement 
		Must be done manually (alignement will be available in M2 Milestone)
		
	- Trace visualizer debug tool
		Not yet released (will be release in Engineering release)
		
	- MP3 example
		This example reuse CSD algorithm and must not been distribute outside ST Microelectonics
