*****************************
* Nomadik Kernel 0.8.0      *
*****************************

The release comprises one .tgz file holding the following features:
	- Component manager binary & api
 	- Synchronous & Hybrid execution engine binaries
 	- Component tool chain binary
 	- Example source codes (Hello World, Training, MP3, User Fifo)
 	- Documentations (User guide, programming model, CM API, MPC API)
 		User guide not fully in line with delivery

Supported target:
	- Stn8810 SAA
	- STn8815 SAA & SVA Cut A0/B0

Changes:
--------
- [Tools] Composite Components are now built as Primitive ones
- [Tools] Improve syntax/semantic checking
- [Tools] Added support for Provided and Required Interface Collection (WARNING: a MMDSP+ compiler patch is REQUIRED)
- [Tools] New interrupt management (through interrupt keyword and strict local naming)
- [Tools] Internal Defect (-nk compilation flag duplication) correction 
- [Tools] Binding component now compile with CFLAGS=-O4, can be overwrite though BC_CFLAGS
	
- [CM] Add dynamic management of required and provided interface collection
- [CM] New memory management layer providing preferred bank and alignment features
- [CM] New MPC abstraction layer
- [CM] Composite Components managed as primitive ones
- [CM] New loader/instantiater layer: cut into two layer a generic one and a mmdsp dependent one
- [CM] Deep Code cleaning 
- [CM] Add introspection API
- [CM] Add priority parameter to CM_InstantiateComponent
- [CM] Several API changes (see cm-api.chm):
             - DSP -> MPC
             - Introspection API
             - New parameters for CM_InstantiateComponent, CM_AllocMpcMemory 

- [EE] New interrupt management 
- [EE] Code cleaning

- [Examples] Added collection to MP3 example (WARNING: a MMDSP+ compiler patch is REQUIRED)
- [Examples] Added nmf_ee support

- Adding nmf_ee execution environment delivery

Bug fixes:
----------
- [CM] [ internal ] Memory overflow on communication objects (fifo params)
- [EE] [ Defect #26822 ] execution engine does not provide CFLAGS in .conf file
- [CM] [ Defect #25869 ] GetComponentProperty functions return bad error
- [CM] [ Defect #25271 ] infinite loop when Instantiate after Destroy 
- [CM] [ Defect #26639 ] calling the component manager from C++ code does not work
- [CM] [ Defect #26640 ] error if HCL dma.h included after cm/inc/cm.h 
- [CM] [ Defect #28106 ] MPC memory status returned in bytes 
- [CM] [ Defect #25099 ] problem when binding interrupt 
- [TOOLS] [ Defect #25147 ] lexical error with signed property value
- [TOOLS] [ Defect #25869 ] Tools generate wrong property name
- [TOOLS] [ Defect #24515 ] Error if .conf file ends with a comment
- [TOOLS] [ Defect #27521 ] multiple instanciation of a component in a .arch does not work
- [Examples] [ Defect #25791 ] first build of examples fails (missing "build" directory)


Notes:
------
        - Communication scheme uses active polling when overflow on communication fifos
                Active polling will be removed when Panic mechanism will be integrated (M2 Milestone)

	- MMDSP debugger not component aware in MMDSP toolset 3.0.x

	- Synchronous & Hybrid execution engines
		Priority mechanism not fully tested and allowed only in composite 
		component not through Component manager API (will be available in M2 Milestone)
	- Inter-MPC distribution not supported due to hardware limitation on STn8815A0
		Will be fixed in STn8815B0
	- Only the 24bits mode supported on MPC
	- No cross calling between ESRAM and SDRAM Code
		A component code must fit in one segment only
		
	- Safe reconfiguration will be available in M2 Milestone
	    User must check itself network activity before reconfigure it
		
	- MP3 example
		This example reuse CSD algorithm and must not been distribute outside ST Microelectronics

Pre-requires:
-------------
	- At least MMDSP toolset 3.1.0 must be used (http://gnx1227.gnb.st.com:8080/releases/release_list.php)
		MMDSP debugger not component aware
          WARNING: MMDSP Toolset 3.1.1 does not worked with NMF (issue with THIS switching)
	- Java Runtime Environment  (http://java.sun.com/)
		At least JRE 1.5 (on Linux please use at least JRE 1.6 due to JVM bug regarding execution access rights)
		(also installed by the MMDSP toolset 3.x)
		(also available for downloading on https://codex.cro.st.com/projects/nmf/)
   	- Gnu tools, 
		* On Linux, installed by default
		* On Windows, you must install either:
			+ CygWin
			+ MinGW/MSYS (http://www.mingw.org)
				MSYS-1.0.10.exe (at least)
				MinGW-5.1.3.exe (at least)
				(also available for downloading on https://codex.cro.st.com/projects/nmf/)
        

Test environment on NDK15:
--------------------------
	- Environments:
		MPC: SAA & SVA
			* For NDK10 platform, ESRAM data are mapped to SDRAM segments as no ESRAM on 8810
		Execution Engine: Synchronous, Hybrid
		MMDSP: 3.1.0
		ARM: RVCT 3.0 SP1 Build 651 AND RVCT 2.2 Build 593
