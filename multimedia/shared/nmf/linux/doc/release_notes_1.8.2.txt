     doc/nmf

[NMF Linux]
     * Add support of Android system (for both ndk20 and mop500_ed boards)
       => implies some small updates of the CM User Proxy library
       => update of the build system (Makefiles, ...)
     * Los update: semaphores are now implemented by using the POSIX sem instead
       of the IPC sem (also to work around some Android issues)
       => user of the liblos on non-android platform must now link their binaries
          with librt (using -lrt option, etc, not required on android platform)
     * Provide liblos for workstation (platform x86-linux)
     * Provide libnmfee.a (Component on workstation + Executive Engine on workstation)
       for platform x86-linux. This library was previously delivered in
       component nmf_linuxee.

Bug fixes:
---------

     * Add C++ version of CM_BindComponentFromUser() and CM_UnbindComponentFromUser()
