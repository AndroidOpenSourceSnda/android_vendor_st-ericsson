 \file GPIOManager_PlatformSpecific.h
 \brief This file is NOT a part of the module release code.
	 		All inputs needed by the GPIO Manager module that can only
	 		be resolved at the project level (at integration time)
	 		are met through this file.
	 		It is the responsibility of the integrator to generate
	 		this file at integration time and meet all the input
	 		dependencies.


 \note      The following sections define the dependencies that must be
           met by the system integrator. The way these dependencies
           have been resolved here are just for example. These dependencies
           must be appropriately resolved based on the platform being used.
