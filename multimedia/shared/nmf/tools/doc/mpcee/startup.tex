\chapter{Startup}
MMDSP startup code is written in assembly code. After a reset MMDSP start code
execution at address 0. This code then jump into my\_init\_core().

my\_init\_core() then execute following algorithm:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Test isSleeping global to test if we are waking up from an ULP sleep. If
  this is the case then jump to sleep\_wakeup().
  \item Else test for isFirstBoot global to see if this is a normal boot. If
  this is the case then jump into init\_core() where the MMDSP init sequence
  will occur.
  \item Else we detect an invalid jump in 0. This generally occur when we use an
  unbinded interface, so we jump into Unbinded() where a panic will be
  triggered.
\end{itemize}
