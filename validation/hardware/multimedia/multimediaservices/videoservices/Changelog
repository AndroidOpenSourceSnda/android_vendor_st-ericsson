-- 1.2 -- 15 July 2009
Description:
* update Makefile to get a VideoTests executable using videoservice dynamic library

-- 1.3 -- 17 July 2009
Description:
* update of VideoServices.c to access a test driver of camera for 8500 ED
* update of VideoTests.c to Initiliase/Set 8Mpix sensor/"Start Preview"/Take a picture and write result on SD card 
   on  "VideoTests -m=1" command line
* update of Makefile to add CAMERA_8500_ED_TEST definition

Switchs:
CAMERA_8500_ED_TEST: to enable for test of camera on 8500 Ed using camera test driver (compatibility with patch of camera test driver in kernel)

Dependencies: HATS_8500_DEV_MAIN_PACK_HATS_1.24 + patch of kernel for camera test driver

Restrictions for 8500 ED camera tests:
- only the following sequence is supported:
1/ VidServ_CameraSensorInit (initialise the link with camera driver)
2/ VidServ_CameraSetSensorProp (to select the sensor)
3/ VidServ_CameraPreviewStart (to put the sensor in streaming mode)
4/ VidServ_CameraTakeAShot to take a picture. You can call it  several times (raw capture file is converted to BMP file to falicitate display on PC)
Notes: 
  - camera tests driver is not implemented to respect the HSI timing.
  - Tested with MOP board
