Install instructions for the USB driver:

1. IMPORTANT: In a case that LibUSB-Win32 (filter driver) is installed on the system, remove it using its uninstaller (it can be found in "Add or Remove Programs" or "Start -> Programs -> LibUSB-Win32" program group).
2. Disconnect all mobile devices.
3. Make sure that you do not have displayed "Found New Hardware Wizard" or "Hardware Update Wizard" window during steps 4 and 5.
4. To install USB driver run one of the following installer executables:

    32-bit OS: dpinst_x86.exe
    64-bit OS: dpinst_x64.exe

5. Follow installer instructions.

   Windows 7: When the following message appears "Windows can't verify the publisher of this driver software", choose to "Install this driver software anyway"

6. Connect mobile device and reset it (or turn it on) to get it into service mode.
7. Windows XP: When "Found New Hardware Wizard" appears (if it doesn't, try to use another USB port) follow these steps:

    a) do not connect to Windows Update (select "No, not this time") and click "Next"
    b) select "Install the software automatically" and click "Next"
    c) wait for installation to complete and then click "Finish"

   Windows 7: Installation may end with dialog saying "Device driver software was not successfully installed" because "Device unplugged", even when driver is installed correctly. This is caused by device which switches itself to different mode and is disconnected before end of driver installation.

8. Driver is now installed.
