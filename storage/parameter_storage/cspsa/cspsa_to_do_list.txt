Crash Safe Parameter Storage Area To-do List
============================================

- Updates after reviews.

- Reliable writes in os-free low level MMC driver should be implemented.

- Close on hang-up? If a Linux user space client dies or is killed e.g. during shutdown or for other 
  reason the server currently do not close the area on hang-up. Should it?
  
- Select tests for target. Running all regression tests on target takes very long time and is not
  really necessary. E.g. TC1 could possibly be removed and only run on PC.
  
- Protection from starting cspsa servers with the same area. Today it is possible to start several
  servers with the same name/config. Might cause confusion.

- log -> asciidoc. It would be nice with a tool that could parse the regression test log file and
  create text documents suitable for parsing with asciidoc. The resulting image should be a table of
  all the tests cases and their results.
