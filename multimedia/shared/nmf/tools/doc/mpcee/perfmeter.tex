\chapter{Perfmeter}
Perfmeter module is in charge to provide MMDSP load information. This allow CM
driver code to select MMDSP frequency for power savings but can also be use by
any client (display MMDSP load for example).

MPCEE will provide to the CM driver a counter that count the number of time
MMDSP spent to work. It will use a PRCMU timer running at 32Khz as the time
base.

MPCEE will call mpcload\_SetIdleState() and mpcload\_SetLoadState() repectively
when going in ulp or idle mode and when exiting ulp or idle mode. These funcions
will update information report to the CM driver which consist to three parts:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a 48 bits counter that count time MMDSP is working.
  \item a 48 bits timestamp that give the last time MMDSP go from idle to load
  or from load to idle.
  \item state which give current MMDSP state, either idle or load.
\end{itemize}
These informations are located in a sdram buffer to allow CM driver to access
them even when MMDSP is in ulp mode.

To insure coherency of these data an 8 bits update counter is inserted before
them. This counter is increment each time these informations are updated. This
allow CM driver to retry read when it detect incoherent state.
