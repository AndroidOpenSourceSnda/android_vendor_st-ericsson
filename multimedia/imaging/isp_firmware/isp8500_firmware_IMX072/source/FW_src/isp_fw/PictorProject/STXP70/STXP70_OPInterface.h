/// API to initialise an IRQ. It accepts the following arguments:
/// - ID 					: 	Specifies the IRQ number which is to be initialised
/// - Level 				: 	Specifies the level to be assigned to the IRQ
/// - Synchro				: 	If 1, interrupt input synchronization for IRQ ID is 
///								enabled else it is disabled
/// - Enable				:	If 1, then IRQ ID is enabled else it is disabled.
///								A disabled IRQ will not trigger an interrupt into
///								the core even if the corresponding event occurs.
/// - Trigger				:	If 1, then the IRQ status is marked as pending.
///								Normally used to software trigger an IRQ
