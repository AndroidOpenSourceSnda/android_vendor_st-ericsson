 * When configured to be signal based, Do_Dispatch() sends a signal (signal 
 * name is DO_DISPATCH) to the dispatcher process. The dispatcher will route 
 * the corresponding event signal to the event subscriber(s). Do_Dispatch() 
 * will always execute in Wait Mode (i.e. once Do_Dispatch() returns, the event 
 * signals have been sent to all the subscribers).
 *
 * If Confirm is TRUE, the function will returns the number of subscribers 
 * currently registered for EVENT_ID. 
 *
 * Note that using Confirm set to TRUE is an exception rather than the rule. 
 * Event Channels normally don't require confirmation from subscribers.
 *
 * It is also important to notice that the event subscribers must determine 
 * themselves whether an event requires confirmation or not. This information 
 * is not part of the event signal sent to the event subscribers. Event 
 * subscribers must refer to the Reference Manual for the category providing 
 * the event channel in question to determine if it requires confirmation or 
 * not.
 *
 * Note also that macros have been defined to help writing event dispatching 
 * functions. When these macros are used, Do_Dispatch() does not have to be 
 * called directly.
 *
 * @param [in] EVENT_ID  The identification of the event that has been 
 *                       detected.
 * @param [in] Confirm   TRUE indicates that the caller wants to know the 
 *                       number of subscribers which the event was sent to. 
 *                       FALSE indicates that the number of subscribers to the 
 *                       event is not required.
 * @param [in] AllocSize Size of the of the event signal in bytes.
 * @param [in] Data_p    Pointer to the event signal data buffer.
 *
 * @return When called with Confirm equal to TRUE, the function returns the
 *         number of subscribers for EventID (a value between 0 and
 *         SIZE_OF_PROCESSLIST). Otherwise, the function returns always 0.
 *
 * @sigbased Yes
 * @signalid DONE_DISPATCH
 * @waitmode Wait mode
 * @related None
