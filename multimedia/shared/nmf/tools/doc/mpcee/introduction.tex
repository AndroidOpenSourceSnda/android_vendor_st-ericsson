\chapter{Introduction}
NMF technology provide both a component base development environment but also a
runtime engine which is the component execution environment. In the case of
MMDSP this runtime engine is call MPCEE. Design specification of MPCEE is the
subject of this document.

Main property of NMF runtime engines (and so of MPCEE) is that they use a run to
completion model. This means that user function run to their end before a new
function is selected. 

There is two variants of MPCEE call synchronous scheduler and hybrid scheduler.
In the case of synchronous scheduler there is no preemption between priorities
whereas in the hybrid scheduler there is preemption between priorities. In both
cases there are three levels of priorities.

This report will only document hybrid scheduler since synchronous scheduler is
no more in use.
