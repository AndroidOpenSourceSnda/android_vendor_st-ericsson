**********************************************************
* Nomadik Multiprocessing Framework (version 0.8.6)      *
**********************************************************

The release comprises one .tgz file holding the following features:
	- Component manager binary & api
 	- Synchronous & Hybrid execution engine binaries
 	- Component tool chain binary
 	- Example source codes (Hello World, Training, MP3, User Fifo)
 	- Documentations (User guide, programming model, CM API, MPC API)
 		User guide not fully in line with delivery
 
Sources are delivered in another .tgz.

Supported target:
	- Stn8810 SAA
	- STn8815 SAA & SVA Cut A0/B0


Changes:
--------
[CM]
	- Modify CM_GetComponentRequiredInterfaceBinding function in order to return directly right interface
	  	name if interface is a collection.
	- Provide CM_ReadComponentAttribute function implementation and attribute could be declared in every memory.
	- Add Panic mechanism which informing Host CM about MMDSP (see below).
		For OS Integrator: You must trap second IT coming from each MMDSP and call CM_getPanicDescription
		 that will Log an error.
	- Add mutual exclusion for synchronize CM API. This imply OSAL evolution.
	- Regenerate idt file in build directory (MPC and host) and named anonymous type in order to manipulate them
		in stubs and skeletons.
	- Make right alignment of event FIFO elsewhere this will break double MMDSP memory alignment.
	- Remove EE from component return in introspection list.
	- Introduce component life cycle for tracing invalid state.
	
[MPC Executive Engine]
	- Add Panic mechanism which informing Host CM about MMDSP. Today, when occur the panic is logged.  
 	   Reason                   | Information                       | Behavior
	   -------------------------------------------------------------------
	   COM_FIFO_OVERFLOW        | 0                                 | Fatal panic, stop MPC
	   INTERNAL_PANIC           | Not interpreted                   | idem
	   USER_STACK_OVERFLOW      | Faulting address & SPu            | Abort current task & start next event (detect through exception)
	   SYSTEM_STACK_OVERFLOW    | Faulting address &  SPu           | idem
	   UNALIGNED_LONG_ACCESS    | Indicative Faulting address & SPu | idem
	   EVENT_FIFO_OVERFLOW      | 0                                 | Abort current task & start next event
	   PARAM_FIFO_OVERFLOW      | 0                                 | idem
	   USER_PANIC               | Not interpreted                   | idem
	
[Execution Environment]
	- Update OSAL in order to connect Mutex for mutual exclusion.
	- Update semphore management
		
[Tools] 
	- Rewrite dependencies checking in order to include every manipulated files.
	- Check in tools that primitive type really handled by processor target (like int64 on mmdsp).
	- Update IDL parser in order to better recognize C grammar.
	- Add many checks.
	- Distinguish syntax color depending on compiler.
	- Remove const modifier in interface descriptor since interface are not constant between two component instances.
	

[Programming model]
	- Allow declaration of attributes in each memory banks

Bug fixes:
----------
 - [ Defect #20532 ] [EE]Scheduler PANIC function silently enters infinite loop
 		Such of error will call Panic EE method which will inform the ARM processor 
 		which will generate a message. Depending on the severity of the error, the behavior 
 		could be to abort the current component stack and switch to the next event or to 
 		stop the DSP execution.
 - [ Defect #25306 ] [Tools] idt files are not copied to the arm directory
 		In fact, the file will be regenerated in host directory and name "xxx.idt.h" as well as in the tmp directory.
		It's not a copy but a regeneration since we need to do some replacement.
 - [ Defect #28871 ] [Tools] propagation of compilation option in composite component
		Solved with other bug which generate all code and object in a directory dedicated 
		to each top-level component compilation (one pass to nmfconfc).
 - [ Defect #28944 ] [Tools] default subset of memories for attributes with string value
 		If you declare attribute that require special memory, you have to declare this memory yourself.
 - [ Defect #28984 ] [Tools] collection in composite requires memories option at XROM
 - [ Defect #28990 ] [Tools] Propagation of 'memories' option in composite
 		Options memories, needlibc and incdir are now prohibited for composite component.
 - [ Defect #29040 ] [CM] erroneous value for CM_GetComponentPropertyNumber in composite
 - [ Defect #29154 ] [CM] CM_GetComponentListHeader not empty after the last CM_DestroyInstance
 		CM_GetComponentListHeader will now return an empry list when last instance has been destroy.
 - [ Defect #29155 ] [CM] possibility to destroy the executive engine
 		Remove EE handle from component return in introspection list.
 - [ Defect #29856 ] [tools] nmfitfc does not see dependencies on included .idt files
 - [ Defect #29857 ] [Tools] some primitive types not supported in IDL
 		Remove double words type from programming model.
 - [ Defect #29859 ] [Tools] some primitive types not supported in attribute declaration (ADL)
 		A more readable error will be generated by checking that attribute type really exists on target processor.
 - [ Defect #29899 ] [Tools] "const" item for parameter type not supported in method declaration (IDL)
 - [ Defect #29900 ] [Tools] enumeration embedded inside structure declaration is not supported (IDL)
 - [ Defect #29912 ] [Tools] 'struct' item not supported in result type of a method (IDL)
 - [ Defect #29928 ] [Tools] 'enum' item not supported in result type of a method (IDL)
 - [ Defect #29997 ] [Tools] properties in composite without subcomponent?
 		Same defect as Defect #29040
 - [ Defect #30090 ] [Tools] conflicts with prefix and collection size
 - [ Defect #30109 ] [CM] fifo location in ESRAM does not work
 - [ Defect #30429 ] [Tools] Warning: incorrect number of parameters with composite containing subcomponents 
   binded with interfaces collection facility
 - [ Defect #30432 ] [Tools] Instantiation of a composite component containing subcomp. binded using the interface 
   collection facility generates a mem. access violation
		This bug have two reasons: 
			1) we don't generate all thisToRelocate in sub-component bindings through collection 
			2) issue in MMDSP compiler which relocate either constant when declared inside array 
			   (which overwrite our thisTorelocate done before calling init method).
 - [ Defect #30761 ] [Tools] CM_GetComponentRequiredInterfaceBinding don't provide server collection index properly
		Defect fixed and proposal implemented.
 - [ Defect #30782 ] [Tools] Interface with interrupt line 1 is accepted and can generate some problems at runtime
 		Check in tools that interruption line in range [2 .. 31].
 - [ Defect #31438 ] [Tools] Java exception in the case of a composite containing a subcomponent using the same 
   templatename as the composite itself
 		Check that there is no loop in instantiation call graph.
 - [ Defect #31703 ] [Tools] Java exception on binding test class
 		This defect apply huge change on generated IDL/IDT. Thus, IDT must be regenerated in order to named anonymous 
 		defined type and can't be used from source directory.
 - [ Defect #31715 ] [Tools] re-declaration of 'enum' with typedef (IDL)

Notes:
------
    - Communication scheme uses active polling when overflow on communication fifos
			Active polling will be removed when Panic mechanism will be integrated (M2 Milestone)

	- Synchronous & Hybrid execution engines
		Priority mechanism not fully tested 
	- Inter-MPC distribution not supported due to hardware limitation on STn8815A0
	- No cross calling between ESRAM and SDRAM Code
		A component code must fit in one segment only
		
	- Safe reconfiguration will be available in M2 Milestone
	    User must check itself network activity before reconfigure it
		
	- MP3 example
		This example reuse CSD algorithm and must not been distribute outside ST Microelectronics
                Today, this example only runs on STn8815a (due to APD HCL/Services packages issues)
