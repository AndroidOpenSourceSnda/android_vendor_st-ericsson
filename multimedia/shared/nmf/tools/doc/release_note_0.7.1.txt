**********************************************************
* Nomadik Multiprocessing Framework Patch Release v0.7.1 *
**********************************************************

The release comprises one .tgz file holding the following features:
	- Component manager binary & api
 	- Synchronous & Hybrid execution engine binaries
 	- Component tool chain binary
 	- Example source codes (Hello World, User Guide, MP3, User Fifo)
 	- Documentations (User guide, programming model, CM API, DSP API)
 		User guide not fully in line with delivery

Supported target:
	- Stn8810 SAA
	- STn8815 cut A0 SAA & SVA

Changes:
--------
- none

Bug fixes:
----------
- Corrected issues into nmf_macros.h (NMF debugging macros for RVD debugger)
          (load it examples/common/host/debug/rvd/nmf_macros.inc, and call nmf_help)
- Corrected defect #25271
- Corrected issue with filename into loadmap (erroneous end of string)
- Corrected internal issue regarding physical to logical address conversion
- Corrected internal issue on component initialisation CM controller
- Corrected internal issue on Executive Engine initialisation in the CM part
- Corrected internal issue regarding duplicated -nk ac compilation flags


Notes:
------
	- MMDSP debugger not component aware in MMDSP toolset 3.1.x

	- Synchronous & Hybrid execution engines
		Priority mechanism not fully tested and allowed only in composite 
		component not though Component manager API (will be available in M2 Milestone)
	- Inter-DSP distribution not supported due to hardware limitation
		Will be fixed in STn8815B0
	- Only the 24bits mode supported on DSP
	- No cross calling between ESRAM and SDRAM Code
		A component code must fit in one segment only
		
	- Safe reconfiguration will be available in M2 Milestone
	    User must check itself network activity before reconfigure it
	- Memory allocator don't manage alignement 
		Must be done manually (alignement will be available in M2 Milestone)
		
	- MP3 example
		This example reuse CSD algorithm and must not been distribute outside ST Microelectonics

Pre-requires:
-------------
	- At least MMDSP toolset 3.1.0 must be used (http://gnx1227.gnb.st.com:8080/releases/release_list.php)
		MMDSP debugger not component aware
	- Java Runtime Environment  (http://java.sun.com/)
		At least JRE 1.5 
		(also installed by the MMDSP toolset 3.x)
		(also available for downloading on https://codex.cro.st.com/projects/nomadikkernel/)
   	- Gnu tools, 
		* On Linux, installed by default
		* On Windows, you must install either:
			+ CygWin
			+ MinGW/MSYS (http://www.mingw.org)
				MSYS-1.0.10.exe (at least)
				MinGW-513.exe (at least)
				(also available for downloading on https://codex.cro.st.com/projects/nomadikkernel/)
        

Test environment on NDK15:
--------------------------
	- Environments:
		DSP: SAA & SVA
			* For NDK10 platform, ESRAM data are mapped to SDRAM segments as no ESRAM on 8810
		Execution Engine: Synchronous, Hybrid
	- Tests:
		* Dynamic loading: 
			segment loading
				Mono-instance
				Multi-instances on same DSP
				Multi-instances on both DSP
			error management
		* Communication: 
			synchronous intra-DSP
			asynchronous intra-DSP
			ARM -> DSP
			DSP -> ARM
			error management
		* Memory 
			Alloc and free
		* Misc
			Attributes and properties
