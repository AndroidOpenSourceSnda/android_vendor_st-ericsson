    See tools/doc/file_hierarchies.txt about file tree organization !

    - Toolbox
    
    - Component Manager

    - Execution Engine

    - Think
    
    - LOS


3.1 Component Manager

	- Add compatibility with "XTI v3 Specification; Tracing Chipset API Specification"
	  Now STP timestamp of a message is added at the last databyte send according XTI v3 specification.
	  And STP timestamp is not used elsewhere.
	  
	- Enhance CM_CreateMemoryDomain in order to create ARM only domain
		-> CM_AllocMpcMemory & associated memory API is thus able to manage ESRAM memory using this domain
		-> CM_InsantiateComponent will reject it

	- Added CM_GetDomainCoreId() in order to retrieve the coreId for a given domain.
	

3.2 MPC Execution Engine

	- NMF Print API is now synchronous in order to use sprintf.
		-> Method call will be block till CM has read the string pass as parameter.  

	- Add compatibility with "XTI v3 Specification; Tracing Chipset API Specification"
	  Now STP timestamp of a message is added at the last databyte send according XTI v3 specification.
	  And STP timestamp is not used elsewhere.


3.3 Host Execution Engine

	- Add compatibility with "XTI v3 Specification; Tracing Chipset API Specification"
	  Now STP timestamp of a message is added at the last databyte send according XTI v3 specification.
	  And STP timestamp is not used elsewhere.
	  
	- In order to avoid integration issue due to high number of thread, priority number has been limited (like MPC) to 3:
		background, normal, urgent.
	  Two more hard real-time priorities were reserved for CSCall.
		  ****** API BREAK (following architect request) ******
	
	- Correct vi23483.
	
	- Distribution channel/thread are create/destroy dynamically according to server component priority.
	
	- Virtual interrupt use channel/thread according to server component priority.


3.4 OS integration guidelines

	- Check that CM_ReadMPCString is always call when getting a print service through CM_getServiceDescription.
		-> Elsewhere, the DSP will be block
	
	- CM_OS_GetDomainCoreId() to be implemented	


3.5 Tools

	- NMF on ARM
		
		* Allow direct connection between MPC component and outside ARM Composite. Such construction allowed:
			composite arm.PingerSVA
			{
				provides api.caller as cinput
				requires api.caller as coutput

				contains dsp.Pinger as pinger SVA
				binds 		this.cinput 		to pinger.input		asynchronous fifo=2     
				binds 		pinger.output 		to this.coutput		asynchronous fifo=2    
			}
			
        * Interface headers generate in .hpp files instead of .h (VI 24598)
			-> Impact C++ file which directly include Interface headers.
				Note: Code which include ARM composite header don't need modification. 
		  ****** API BREAK (following media request) ******
		 
        * Don't generate twice same file name (/path/directory/filename) in order to not break Symbian build 
	       (VI 24814: Symbian MMH generated files are incorrect when containing 2 files with same names in diff folders)

    20810   "#pragma interface" is not set automatically by the nmf toolset when calling a method in a referenced interface
    20440   No way to compile some files with specific options
 

5   COMPILATION RULES

5.1 Compilation procedure & options

    Compilation options is fully based on MMENV.
    

5.2 Compilation configurability

    EXPORT_SHARED: can be re-defined for exporting API in a specific manner
    IMPORT_SHARED: can be re-defined for importing API in a specific manner
    
    For Think dynamic configuration, see doxygen documentation (think/doc/nmfthink/index.html).

    
5.3 Installation

    Please define components.txt using RODOS.


6   QA CHECK STATUS

6.1 Compilation warning / error

    - Component manager
        All warnings and errors removed.


6.2 Code Static analysis result

    - Component manager
        Coverity done (each remaining issue could be explained). 
    

6.3 Symbian Creasy scheduler check (valid until dual core ED mode supported)

    Done.

6.4 Confidentiality safe

	Done.
