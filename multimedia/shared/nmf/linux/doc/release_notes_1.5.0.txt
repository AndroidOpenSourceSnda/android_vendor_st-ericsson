**************************************************

The release comprises one .tgz file holding the following features:
    - The needed files to develop NMF applications under Linux:
      (libraries and header)
    - The binaries to run NMF applications on the target.

Source codes can be found in Codex SVN site: 
    http://codex.cro.st.com/svn/viewvc.php/nmf_linux/tags/1.5.0/?roottype=svn&root=nmf
or

Supported target:
    - STn8815
    - STn8820
    
Changes:
--------
[NMF Linux]
     * Provide mmte API in liblos
     * Remove LOS_GetPhysicalAddress() from liblos as it is
       not supported on Linux
     * Add missing files in delivery for compiling the examples.
     * Rework the 'per process' and 'module' cleanup by using the
       new API implemented in nmf_core
       => provide now a real per-process cleanup, even in case of abnormal
          process exit (all remaining process components, bindings, etc are
	  destroyed).
       => provide now a real module cleanup (rmmod) by freeing all NMF
          resources and stopping all MPCs.
     * Update CM_UserInit() (and other CM_USER*()) API implementation.
     * Add proper power managment support on ndk20


Bug fixes:
---------
[NMF Linux]
     * Fix los Makefile for 8820 target.

Notes

Known Issues:
-------------
- XTI and STM traces not tested.

Pre-requires:
-------------
    - Kernel linux 2.6.24_stm23_0022 derived from STLinux 2.3 distribution
      (package stlinux23-arm-kernel) with the kernel config, as provided by
      Nomadik Multimedia Linux (see codex project 'mmdlinux' and its svn tree
      under module linux_kernel: the easiest way to access this environment
      is to use mmtools)
    - GCC ARM compiler 4.2.1 from STLinux 2.3 distribution
    - The tools are provided in a separate package:
      nmf_tools package is required to develop NMF application.
