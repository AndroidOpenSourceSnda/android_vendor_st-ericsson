*****************************
* Nomadik Kernel 0.8.3      *
*****************************

The release comprises one .tgz file holding the following features:
	- Component manager binary & api
 	- Synchronous & Hybrid execution engine binaries
 	- Component tool chain binary
 	- Example source codes (Hello World, Training, MP3, User Fifo)
 	- Documentations (User guide, programming model, CM API, MPC API)
 		User guide not fully in line with delivery

Supported target:
	- Stn8810 SAA
	- STn8815 SAA & SVA Cut A0/B0

Changes:
--------
[Examples] - mp3 now compiles
[Examples] - common Makefile updated for tlm/natif support
[CM] - doxygen comments updated (after Video team feedbacks)
[CM] - correct internal issue regarding NMF coms object location configuration
[Tools] - now use arm-none-eabi-gcc (instead of native gcc) to compute dependencies
[Utils] - docfg: corrected erroeneous string initialisation
[Utils] - docfg: add flags for silent CM init script run

Bug fixes:
----------
 - internals

Notes:
------
        - Communication scheme uses active polling when overflow on communication fifos
                Active polling will be removed when Panic mechanism will be integrated (M2 Milestone)

	- MMDSP debugger not component aware in MMDSP toolset 3.1.x

	- Synchronous & Hybrid execution engines
		Priority mechanism not fully tested 
	- Inter-MPC distribution not supported due to hardware limitation on STn8815A0
		Will be fixed in STn8815B0
	- Only the 24bits mode supported on MPC
	- No cross calling between ESRAM and SDRAM Code
		A component code must fit in one segment only
		
	- Safe reconfiguration will be available in M2 Milestone
	    User must check itself network activity before reconfigure it
		
	- MP3 example
		This example reuse CSD algorithm and must not been distribute outside ST Microelectronics
                Today, this example only runs on STn8815a (due to APD HCL/Services packages issues)

Pre-requires:
-------------
	- At least MMDSP toolset 3.1.1 + dedicated patch must be used (http://gnx1227.gnb.st.com:8080/releases/release_list.php)
		MMDSP debugger not component aware
          WARNING: MMDSP Toolset 3.1.1 alone does not worked with NMF (issue with THIS switching)
          To get MANDATORY patch, please contact Philippe Galliard (philippe.galliard@st.com) or Denis Ferranti (denis.ferranti@st.com)
	- Java Runtime Environment  (http://java.sun.com/)
		At least JRE 1.5 (on Linux please use at least JRE 1.6 due to JVM bug regarding execution access rights)
		(also installed by the MMDSP toolset 3.x)
		(also available for downloading on https://codex.cro.st.com/projects/nmf/)
   	- Gnu tools, 
		* On Linux, installed by default
		* On Windows, you must install either:
			+ CygWin
			+ MinGW/MSYS (http://www.mingw.org)
				MSYS-1.0.10.exe (at least)
				MinGW-5.1.3.exe (at least)
				(also available for downloading on https://codex.cro.st.com/projects/nmf/)
        

Test environment on NDK15:
--------------------------
	- Environments:
		MPC: SAA & SVA
			* For NDK10 platform, ESRAM data are mapped to SDRAM segments as no ESRAM on 8810
		Execution Engine: Synchronous, Hybrid
		MMDSP: 3.1.1 PATCHED (cosyworks 2.11.4 + debugger 3.9.0)
		ARM: RVCT 3.0 SP1 Build 651 AND RVCT 2.2 Build 593
	- Tests:
