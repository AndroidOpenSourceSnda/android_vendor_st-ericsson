The release comprises one .tgz file holding the following features:
    - The needed files to develop NMF applications under Linux:
      (libraries and header)
    - The binaries to run NMF applications on the target.

Source codes can be found in Codex SVN site: 
    http://codex.cro.st.com/svn/viewvc.php/nmf_linux/tags/release_1_6_0/?roottype=svn&root=nmf

Supported target:
    - STn8815-B06
    - STn8820
    
Changes:
--------
[NMF Linux]
     * Add support for 8500 (See "Known Issues")
     * Add support for kernel 2.6.27 (required for target 8500)
     * Make use of mmenv component
     * Rework all the build-system to have nmf_linux as a full mmtools component
       (it doesn't introduce functionnal changes but may introduce some
       unknown issues...)
     * The repository path, where the components (*.elf4nmf) has changed:
       /usr/share/nmf/repository/STn8815
       becomes
       /usr/share/nmf/repository/mmdsp_8815
       STn8820 => mmdsp_8820 and STn8500 => mmdsp_8500

Bug fixes:
---------
[NMF Linux]

Notes
-----
- All warnings/errors of the CMUserProxy are logged through syslog in
  /var/log/user.log
  => in case of problems, don't forget to have a look in this file.
- On 8820, STM traces are not started.
- The tests are not run anymore on STn8815-B06 but only on STn8820 for now
  STn8815-B06 boards are still tested with the think OS and thus are still
  supported under Linux too.
  

Known Issues:
-------------
- XTI and STM traces not tested.
- Target 8500 has been tested on the SVP 2.1 and does not work for now: with the
  SVP 2.1, the first component instantiate blocks the system.

Pre-requires:
-------------
    - MMENV 1.0.3 or later
    - Kernel linux 2.6.24_stm23_0022 derived from STLinux 2.3 distribution
      for target STn8815-B06 or STn8820
    - Kernel linux 2.6.27 for target STn8500
    [ Both kernels and their config are provided by Nomadik Multimedia Linux
      (see codex project 'mmdlinux' and its svn tree under module linux_kernel:
      the easiest way to access this environment is to use mmtools) ]
    - GCC ARM compiler 4.2.1 from STLinux 2.3 distribution
    - The NMF tools are provided in a separate package:
      nmf_tools package is required to develop NMF applications.
