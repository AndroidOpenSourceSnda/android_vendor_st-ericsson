# STErilOemService - Support mechanism for raw OEM RIL request/responses.

## Introduction

The STErilOemService consists of two parts:

1. A service that runs as `com.android.phone` and thus has access to Android's RIL.
   It forwards raw OEM RIL requests from OEM applications onwards to the RIL.
   Unsolicited raw OEM RIL responses are broadcasted to interested OEM applications.

2. A library for OEM applications to use which encapsulates the communication with the service.
   It supports both synchronous and asynchronous operation. See [Important OEM Application Information]
   below.

## Build & Install

Builds as part of the Android build system.

## Testing

See tests/README

## Important OEM Application Information

* OEM applications need to request for the permission "com.stericsson.permission.SEND_RIL_OEM_HOOK"
  in their AndroidManifest.xml

* Unsolicited raw OEM RIL responses are broadcasted using the intent action:
  STErilOemHook.ACTION_UNSOL_RESPONSE_OEM_HOOK_RAW.  The data contained in the broadcast intent
  is extracted by calling `intent.getByteArrayExtra("data")`
