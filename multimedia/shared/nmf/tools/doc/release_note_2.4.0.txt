3   RELEASE CONTENT

    See tools/doc/file_hierarchies.txt about file tree organization !

    - Toolbox

    - Component Manager

    - Execution Engine

    - Think

    - LOS


3.1 Component Manager

    - Add power management of ESRAM and SDRAM.
    
    - Add power management of MPC HardWare IP resources
        When starting a component that need such IP, you have to declare such property in your component:
            property hardware = all
        Thus, when starting and stopping the component, the Component Manager will also clock on and off
        the hardware IP associated with the MPC.
        Note that the property must be declared in the top level component.
    
    - Remove useless OSAL.
    
    - Remove sub priority from API.
    
    - Registering one stub/skel of an interface in C and C++ is now fully supported
    
    - Added migration API
        CM_Migrate(), CM_Unmigrate()
        The basic functionnality is working ok.
        It is a stateful API: only one migrate() allowed, unmigrate() is its counterpart
        More complex use-case will be done when all depending features will be available (prcmu, nmf-ulp, ...)

3.2 MPC Execution Engine

	- Remove sub priority implementation from scheduler.
	

3.3 Host Execution Engine

    - VI 24840   Warning in generated code in hostee
    
    - Add EE_GetVersion API
    
    - In order to not export whole class method outside DLL boundary in Symbian,
        declare class as NONSHARABLE_CLASS.
        
    - Declare composite class destructor as protected in order to force developer to use
        compositeDestroy(instance) method to delete its component.
    
    - compositeDestroy(instance) take a reference as parameter in order to set instance 
      to null.
      
    - Add EE_SetMode API in order to control trace behavior:
        EE_SetMode(EE_CMD_TRACE_ON, 0);     // Enable STM tracing and force network resetting and dumping
        EE_SetMode(EE_CMD_TRACE_OFF, 0);    // Disable STM tracing
    

3.4 OS integration guidelines

    - OSAL_DisablePwrRessource & OSAL_EnablePwrRessource API have been enhanced.
        Parameter conventions are described in t_nmf_power_resourceDescription.
        See Slides for more information.
        Note: ESRAM/SDRAM OSAL implementation is able to manage power chunk by chunk.
            In real implementation you can either just do global memory count or
            bank by bank count according your underlying Power Resource Manager !!
        Note: At the beginning, the CM assume that resource was off.
    
    - Remove useless OSAL. It concern OSAL_DisableInterrupt(), OSAL_EnableInterrupt(),
      OSAL_LockScheduler() and OSAL_UnlockScheduler().
    
    - Remove nomadikSocId (no more used since one compilation by target -> define instead).
    
    - Remove comDomainId from CM_ENGINE_ConfigureMediaProcessorCore
        -> It has been merged with eeDomaindId
        
    - eeDomainId depend on MMDSP base and must be defined like that:
        eeDomain.coreId = ...;
        eeDomain.sdramCode.offset  = 0x0;
        eeDomain.sdramData.offset  = 0x0;
        eeDomain.sdramCode.size    = 0x8000;
        eeDomain.sdramData.size    = 0x40000;
        eeDomain.esramCode.size    = 0x4000;
        eeDomain.esramData.size    = 0x40000;
        
        This is a maximum value due to HW constraint (shift 3) !!!!!!!
        
    - In HostEE OS integration wrapper add such code:
        EXPORT_SHARED void EE_GetVersion(t_uint32 *version) {
            out.EE_GetVersion(version);
        }

        EXPORT_SHARED t_nmf_error EE_SetMode(t_ee_cmd_id aCmdID, t_sint32 aParam) {
            return out.EE_SetMode(aCmdID, aParam);
        }
    
    - Add CM_OS_Migrate() and CM_OS_Unmigrate() wrappers

3.5 Tools

    -  VI 24840   Warning in generated code in hostee
        Null interface generate code that cast NULL pointer to the right method signature

    - Reduce generated file pathname size by:
        - Changing fully qualified name used for distinguish composite compilation by last name.
            -> Thus unicity is compute only on that last name and potential conflict could appear if
               several fully name finish by same last name, this must be checked by user.
            -> This feature could be disabled by using --longpath option
                nmfconfc --longpath ...
        - Remove double "src/" in generated path file name.
        

    - Remove NMF version & date in header of generated files in order to do comparison between
      delivery.
      

3.6 Programming model

    - Pass argument by reference in IDL for C++ is supported.

3.7 Think
    
    - Enable alignment checks to correct vi 25753

    23344   dynamic unbind of ARM-composite interface is not working properly

    20810   "#pragma interface" is not set automatically by the nmf toolset when calling a method in a referenced interface
    20440   No way to compile some files with specific options
