*****************************************************
* Linux Environment (version 2.0.0) "CH'TI Blonde"  *
*****************************************************

The release comprises one .tgz file holding the following features:
    - The needed files to develop NMF applications under Linux:
      (libraries and header)
    - The binaries to run NMF applications on the target.

    http://codex.cro.st.com/svnroot/nmf/nmf_linux/tags/release_2_0_0

Supported target:
    - STn8820
    - STn8500 (MOP500-ED)
    
Changes:
--------
[CM]
     * For general changes (such as CM API update, etc), see the NMF release notes
       in component  com.stericsson.nmf

[NMF Linux]
     * Integrate all changes from NMF 2.0 (mainly the new domains feature)
     * Provide virtual interrupts that can be triggered from any driver to the host EE
       (see CM_DRV_TrigInterrupt() api)
     * Add support for CM Local Semaphores (instead of hardware semaphores) usage.
     * Provide support for configuration at driver load time:
       - Try 'modinfo cm' to see all possible parameters.
       - Use 'insmod cm variable=value ...' to set some of these parameters when
         loading the driver
       - Go and have a look in directory /sys/module/cm/parameters to see the value
         of these parameters once the driver is loaded.
       - The default config on mop500 is:
             cfgSemaphoreTypeHSEM            = 1
       	     cfgCommunicationLocationInSDRAM = 1
       	     cfgSchedulerTypeHybrid_SVA      = 1
       	     cfgMpcYBanks_SVA                = 1
       	     cfgMpcSDRAMCodeSize_SVA         = 2048 Kb
       	     cfgMpcSDRAMDataSize_SVA         = 8096 Kb
       	     cfgSchedulerTypeHybrid_SIA      = 1
       	     cfgMpcYBanks_SIA                = 1
       	     cfgMpcSDRAMCodeSize_SIA         = 2048 Kb
       	     cfgMpcSDRAMDataSize_SIA         = 0 (means data shared with SVA data segment)
     * Add support for STM trace in hostee (requires the trace driver, not yet available)
     * Update and enhance package building, move to rodos, and remove depency on
       files that are not delivered
     * liblos: remove durty dependencies and clean-up building to not depend on libnmf


Bug fixes:
---------
[NMF Linux]

Notes
-----
- All warnings/errors of the CMUserProxy are logged through syslog in
  /var/log/user.log
  => in case of problems, don't forget to have a look in this file.
- On 8820, STM traces are not started.
  

Known Issues:
-------------
- XTI and STM traces not tested.
- STM traces are not available on mop500-ed

Pre-requires:
-------------
    - MMENV 1.5.0 or later
    - Kernel linux 2.6.27 as provided by Nomadik Multimedia Linux
      (see codex project 'mmdlinux' and its svn tree under module linux_kernel:
      the easiest way to access this environment is to use mmtools) ]
    - GCC ARM compiler 4.2.1 from STLinux 2.3 distribution
    - The NMF tools are provided in a separate package:
      nmf_tools package is required to develop NMF applications.
