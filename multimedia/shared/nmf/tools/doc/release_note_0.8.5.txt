Changes:
--------
[CM]
	- NMF ready for user space operating system process:

		+ Clarification of Internal and integration API: CM API and CM Syscall API distinguished
		+ CM split in several entities: MC engine, CM Kernel Proxy and CM user Proxy component
	- Update documentation
	- Support of new CM initialization API
	- Added STn8820 support
        - Added MMDSP+ debugger new loadmap support (require at least MMGDB debugger 3.9.2)

[MPC Executive Engine]
        - XTI support cleaning
        - Added STn8820 support
	
[Execution Environment]
	- Update bare machine in order to accept both user or kernel bindings.
	- Add nmf_tlm environment for TLM
		+ Added support into examples for natif gcc 32-bit mode (TLM)
		+ Updated delivery(ies) target to deliver natif and 8820 target(s)
		
[Tools] 
	- Update Tools to display better understandable help and put shell script to minimum by 
	  handling option fully in Java.
	- Add user binding component generator (can be activate through nmfiftc -user2mpc or nmfitfc -mpc2user)
	
[ Programming Model ]
	- In order to limit issue and confusing on user side, don't rename declared type either for itf or idt file.
	
[ Examples ]
	- Corrected erroneous mmgdb path

Bug fixes:
----------
- [ Defect #28653 ] [CM] maximum value of fifo size parameter with binding operations
		Size of fifo has been limited by MAX_COMMUNICATION_FIFO_SIZE defined to 256 in limits.h. 
		Furthermore, CM_BindComponentAsynchronous and CM_BindComponentFromHost return out of memory 
		in case of CM_NO_MORE_MEMORY.
- [ Defect #28834 ] [Tools] multiple declaration of the same option for primitive component
		Furthermore, toolset check that option was known by toolset.
- [ Defect #28847 ] [Tools] no checking on option declaration
- [ Defect #29801 ] [CM] Introspection API no error returned by CM_GetComponentRequiredInterfaceBinding 
	when no bind exist
		Return CM_INTERFACE_NOT_BINDED error if required interface not binded during unbind or 
		CM_GetComponentRequiredInterfaceBinding
- [ Defect #29966 ] [Examples] configuration with one mpc are not supported
- [ Defect #29992 ] [CM] CM_GetComponentRequiredInterfaceBinding problem using an asynchronous bind between 
	2 components instantiated on 2 different cores
- [ Defect #30004 ] [CM] The fct. GetComponentRequiredInterfaceBinding behavior should be clarified when the 
	server is the host.
	NMF_HOST_COMPONENT is now returned
- [ Defect #30014 ] [Tools] TARGET variable ignored by tools
- [ Defect #30062 ] [Tools] Possibility to define a composite component with the same type and the same localName
- [ Defect #30077 ] [Tools] A Java exception is generated at the compilation with a conf. file containing a large 
	number for an interface collection size
- [ Defect #30098 ] [Tools] Interface collection size usage with life-cycle interfaces
		Tools now check that construction and print error.
- [ Defect #30099 ] [Tools] Interfaces collection size with interrupt interfaces
		Check that interrupt interface is not a collection and that interface type is rtos.itdispatcher.handler.
- [ Defect #30300 ] [CM] fifo notify interface for writer does not work when fifo is flushed
		A comment has been added into CM_FlushFifo to warn the user that the informPusher notify interface will 
		not be called.
- [ Defect #30354 ] [Tools] Naming conflict with the 'data' keyword in interface files (.itf)
		Use _xyuv_data name for generated binding component.
- [ Defect #30863 ] Stack size of execution engine is limited
		Stack size have been set to 3Ko for synchronous execution engine.
		This is only a patch, The stack management will really be fixed in NMF Beta.
- [ Toolset Bug#: 131] Method events are missing in XTI Trace with Nmf 0.8.3 and 0.8.4
- [ Defect #30107 ] [CM] CM_CreateUserFifo: no check on fifo size
		nbElem must be in range ]01 .. MAX_COMMUNICATION_FIFO_SIZE] and
		sizeElem must be greter that 0. 
- [ Internal Defect]: [CM] Erroneous MPC Event Fifo alignment
                      [CM] Loadmap cleaning

Notes:
------
    - Communication scheme uses active polling when overflow on communication fifos
			Active polling will be removed when Panic mechanism will be integrated (M2 Milestone)

	- Synchronous & Hybrid execution engines
		Priority mechanism not fully tested 
	- Inter-MPC distribution not supported due to hardware limitation on STn8815A0
	- No cross calling between ESRAM and SDRAM Code
		A component code must fit in one segment only
		
	- Safe reconfiguration will be available in M2 Milestone
	    User must check itself network activity before reconfigure it
		
	- MP3 example
		This example reuse CSD algorithm and must not been distribute outside ST Microelectronics
                Today, this example only runs on STn8815a (due to APD HCL/Services packages issues)

	- Mutual exclusion of concurrent CM API call not handled yet, will be available in 0.8.6 version.
