Thermal sensor temperature conversion library
---------------------------------------------

The libthermalutils library offers an interface to convert thermistor
sensor temperature from millivolts to degree celsius and vice versa.
At present only few sensors are supported and can be extended to
support other sensors for ux500 platforms.

Every ux500 platform will have its own xml configuration file named
thermal_sensors_ux500.xml located in /system/etc/ path. Typically,
configuration will have list of sensors and their characteristics
of inflexions points.

<Sensors>
<Count>1</Count>
<Sensor name="xtal_temp" part="NCP15XM472J03RC_1800V">
  <Characteristics count="x">
     <InflexionPoint temp="-40" adcout="1734"/>
     <InflexionPoint temp="-30" adcout="1682"/>
     .
     .
     .
     <InflexionPoint temp="125" adcout="90"/>
  </Characteristics>
</Sensor>
</Sensors>

To add new sensor modify the existing configuration file by
adding <Sensor>...</Sensor> with its characteristics. Also update
the <Count>x</Count> tag with number of supported sensors.

To support new ux500 platform, add new thermal_sensors_ux500.xml
configuration file and update the module build configuration
file to export the file to /system/etc path.

Refer to interface header file for api description.
