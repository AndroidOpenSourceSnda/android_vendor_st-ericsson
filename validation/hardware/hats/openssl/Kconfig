	  The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
	  commercial-grade, full-featured, and Open Source toolkit implementing
	  the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1)
	  protocols as well as a full-strength general purpose cryptography library.
	  The project is managed by a worldwide community of volunteers that use the
	  Internet to communicate, plan, and develop the OpenSSL toolkit and its
	  related documentation.
