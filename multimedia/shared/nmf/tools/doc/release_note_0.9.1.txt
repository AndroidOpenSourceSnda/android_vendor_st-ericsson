**********************************************************
	"Compilé, c'est gagné" (M. Guene)
	"La doc, c'est le code" (J.-P. Fassino)

The release comprises one .tgz file holding the following features:
	- Component manager binary & api
 	- Synchronous & Hybrid execution engine binaries
 	- Component tool chain binary
 	- Example source codes (Hello World's, Training, Mandelbrot, User Fifo)
 		Hello world and mp3 Eclipse project delivered
 	- Documentations (User guide, programming model, CM API, MPC API)
 		User guide not fully in line with delivery
 
Sources are delivered in another .tgz.

Supported target:
	- STn8815 SAA & SVA Cut A0/B0/C0
	
Supported environments:
	- nmf_bare: 	based on Nomadik HCL/services libraries
	- nmf_Think:	based on Think component-based OS
	- nmf_os21: 	based on ARM OS21

Changes:
--------
[CM]
	 
[MPC Executive Engine]
 	- Panic for COMS FIFO overflow no more generated on MPC
 		Infinite loop until host has pop some element.
        This potentially will drive MPC to dead if Host is dead. But we assume, this is not a issue.
	- Communication interrupt (IT11) now mask other ITs when scheduling event in order to not
		fall into reentrancy issue with potential lost of event.
	
[OS integration]
	- Nomadik Multiprocessing Environment (NME) API.
		Available for Bare, Think, OS21 and TLM.
	- nmf_ee renamed nmf_think in order to break ambiguity (content not changed).
	- All environment now developed as component and compiled through NMF tool chain.
	
[Tools] 
	- Allow singleton component on composite component.
		Only one instance of such component include in final ELF binary file.
 
[Programming model]


Bug fixes:
----------
	- [ Defect #34676 ] [TOOLS] Errors for multiples singletons into the same composition not always 
	  explicit enough
		This construction is accepted and the singleton component will be instantiate only one time 
		in composition.
		For information, only configuration of first singleton instance is done, other are ignored. 
	- [ Defect #34918 ] [Tools] error if string constant declared with very long size (IDL)
		Limit define value string as 255 characters
	- [ Defect #34923 ] [Tools] 't_physical_address' type unsupported as a structure field (IDL)
	- [ Defect #35069 ] [TOOLS] config. file with the 'interrupt' keyword in the provided interface 
	  name
	  	"prefix" and "interrupt" accepted as interfaceName.
	- [ Defect #35160 ] [CM] value from attribute assigned to untyped attribute
		In order to be assigned, an attribute must be typed in the ADL.
		Tool updated for checking that.
	- [ Defect #35237 ] [CM] PARAM_FIFO_OVERFLOW with intensive parallel communication under 
	  os21
	- [ Defect #35240 ] [CM] memory access violation in CM_GetAllocStatus under OS21
	- [ Defect #35257 ] [Tools] error #59 when using big constant as array size in method 
	  parameter (IDL)
	  	Replaced by error already existing #91: Integer format not recognized or too long.
		Error #59 removed.
	- [ Defect #35258 ] [Tools] no check on '#define' with very long identifier name (IDL)
	- [ Defect #35259 ] [Tools] character constant identifier used in enum declaration (IDL)
		Added in grammar (parser and programming model) that enum as character accepted.
	- [ Defect #35260 ] [Tools] enum declared with two identical fields (IDL)
	- [ Defect #35304 ] [Tools] no error with unbinded extended interface inside composite (ADL)
	- [ Defect #35306 ] [Tools] ac error in case of method with parameter type longer than 32bits
	- [ Defect #35309 ] [Tools] method with return parameter is allowed in asynchronous 
	  communication (IDL)
	- [ Defect #35332 ] [TOOLS] Async. binding fifo size = 0 in a composite conf. file
	- [ Defect #35333 ] [TOOLS] Composite conf. file with an asynchronous binding large fifo size
	- [ Defect #35336 ] [TOOLS] Required lifecycle interfaces should not accept CollectionSize
		Since component can provide lifecycle interface, but since this interface are handled 
		in a specific way. Requireing such interfaces will be disallowed.
	- [ Defect #35345 ] [TOOLS] Octal or Hexa for CollectionIndex in composite conf. binding 
	  instructions
	- [ Defect #35356 ] [ee] mutex problem in IT11
		All interrupt will be masked when calling Sched_Event in  IT11.
	  

Known Issues:
-------------


Notes:
------
	- Synchronous & Hybrid execution engines
		Priority mechanism not fully tested 
	- Inter-MPC distribution not supported due to hardware limitation on STn8815A0
	- No cross calling between ESRAM and SDRAM Code
		A component code must fit in one memory segment only
		
	- MP3 example supported only on nmf_bare environment.
		This example reuse CSD algorithm and must not been distribute outside ST Microelectronics.
		Today, this example only runs on bare machine (due to APD HCL/Services packages issues).
	- Some link issue with GNU toolchain could occur in examples until HCL/Services compiled with 
		correct flags. 


Pre-requires:
-------------
	- At least Nomadik Toolset 1.0.0 Beta
