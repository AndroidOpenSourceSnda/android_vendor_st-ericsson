\chapter{Interrupts dispatcher}

Interrupts dispatcher module has for role to reduce code use for interrupt entry
and exit sequence (mainly to reduce instruction cache pressure). This avoid
duplication of entry and exit interrupt sequence in user interrupt handler since
Users interrupt handler are just normal functions.

Dispatcher will be executed by all MMDSP interrupts with the exception of MPCEE
one (interrupts 2, 11 and 31).
Dispatcher excecute the following sequence of code:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Save needed MMDSP registers.
  \item Find from where we jump into itDispatcher() to find wanted irq number.
  \item Switch THIS to the component that will handle interrupt. Save previous
  one on the stack.
  \item Jump into user interrupt handler.
  \item After return from the user interrupt handler then restore original THIS.
  \item Restore MMDSP registers.
  \item Return to interrupted code.
\end{itemize}
