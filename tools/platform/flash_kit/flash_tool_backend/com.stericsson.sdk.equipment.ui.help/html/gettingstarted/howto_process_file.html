		<h1>Howto process a file to flash</h1>
		<p>
			Processing a file to flash (flashing) is a common task where some updated platform software will be written
			to persistent storage on target. A file that can be processed is called a flash archive and is created as
			a result of the post-build process when building the platform software or part of the platform software.
		</p>
		<h2>Pre-requisites</h2>
		<p>
			Please make sure the preferences are correctly configured as described in
			<a href="overview_preferences.html">Flash Kit Preferences</a>.
			Also make sure that:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A connection profile used for flashing is set as active connection profile</li>
			<li>Flash Tool Backend accepts equipment connections</li>
		</ul>
