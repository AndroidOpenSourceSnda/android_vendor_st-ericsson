# This test case tests abort-rx functionality provided by ISP FW through PE SystemSetup_e_Flag_abortRx_OnStop_Byte0
# page element in pre-run case. i.e. frame SystemSetup_e_Flag_abortRx_OnStop_Byte0 is set before START command.
# important : In abort-rx test case HOST can not know whether a SMIA-Rx abort was actually done or not done. So we are testing
# that when ISP receives STOP command it processes it gracefully or not.
