    - Toolbox

    - Component Manager

    - Execution Engine


3.1 Component Manager
  
    - Audio ECR: Put big structure pass from host to MPC on DDR instead of stack
      By convention, structure bigger than 32 MMDSP word are put in DDR.
      
    - Audio ECR: Add CM_BindComponentAsynchronousEx API.
      This method allow to specify where the event fifo must be allocated:
        t_cm_error CM_BindComponentAsynchronousEx(
            const t_cm_instance_handle client,
            const char* requiredItfClientName,
            const t_cm_instance_handle server,
            const char* providedItfServerName,
            t_uint32 fifosize,
            t_cm_mpc_memory_type eventMemType)
      Parameter eventMemType can take as value:
            INTERNAL_XRAM24, ESRAM_EXT24, SDRAM_EXT24
      This method can be used to save XRAM memory by putting event in DDR.

    - Enhance CM_DestroyComponent() and check that all provided interfaces have been
      unbound, and gracefully fail if some are still in use.
    

3.2 MPC Execution Engine

    - Audio ECR: Improvement to interface for big config structs to avoid unnecessary stack need
      In order to don't waste TCM stack, parameters of method containing one parameter bigger 
      than 32 word will be put and marshal in DDR instead of stack.
      Note: to fully exploit this feature and take only few word of stack during ARM -> DSP call,
            don't forget to pass big structure parameter as reference.
      It will be automatic and transparent for users.
      
    - Audio ECR: MMDSP Stub now performance stack computation request for its own processing according interface type.
      Thus, you don't have to declared anymore this stack size in the called component.  

    
3.3 Host Execution Engine


3.4 OS integration guidelines

    - CM_ENGINE_BindComponentAsynchronous & CM_OS_BindComponentAsynchronous take a new parameter:
        "t_cm_mpc_memory_type eventMemType" as the last one
    

3.5 Tools

    - Bug Fix in generated code which was wrong when using referenced interface on interface with
      prefix or collection.
      
    - By default, verbosity has been decrease and executed command are not fully displayed
        Use --verbose to display full command
        Or set NMF_VERBOSE=TRUE as environment variable
