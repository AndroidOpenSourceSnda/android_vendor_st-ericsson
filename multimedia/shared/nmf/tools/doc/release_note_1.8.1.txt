1.4	Symbian baseport version:

	Not relevant

1.5	Tools versioning:

	See MMENV for more information.

	ARM compiler version: 
		- RVCT 2.2-sp1-593 for 8815 & 8820 
		- RVCT 4.0 for 8500
	
	MMDSP compiler version
	    - MMDSP Toolset 4.1.0


2	COMMON COMPONENT LIST VERSIONING:

	- Launcher 1.1.1
    - MMENV 1.2.1
    - Java Runtime Environment  (http://java.sun.com/)
        At least JRE 1.5 (on Linux please use at least JRE 1.6 due to JVM bug regarding execution access rights)      


3	RELEASE CONTENT

	- Component Manager
		API for dynamic deployment

	- Execution Engine
		Component scheduler available for MPC and Host (SMP)

	- Think
		Light ARM component-based environment configured for NMF test and development
		This environment is based on Think open source component-based OS

	- LOS
		Light Operating System services API specification


3.1 Component Manager


3.2 MPC Execution Engine


3.3 SMP Execution Engine

3.4 OS integration guidelines

	- File "ee/api/debug.idl" now delivered

3.5 Tools

3.6 Programming model

	- Allow such naming convention on ADL file
		path/name.arch				<- Top Composite file naming, Will be deprecated, prefer ".adl"
		path/name.type				<- Type file naming
		path/name/component.adl		<- Convenient file naming, available for composite, primitive & type
		path/name/name.adl			<- Precise file naming, available for composite, primitive & type
		path/name/name.conf			<- Precise file naming, Will be deprecated, prefer ".adl"

	- Allow synchronous binding between ARM composite component.
		In order to not break compilation, no event/call/callback component are generated for 
		synchronous interface (asynchronous binding is thus disabled for such interface). 


3.7 Think

	- Set default stack size to 8 KBytes
	- Add ILOS_sxaTimer90KhzStart()/ILOS_sxaTimer90KhzStop()/ILOS_sxaTimer90KhzStatus() to control
	  90Khz DSP Timer (HTIMEN)
	- Add ILOS_ConfigSxaDmaChannel() to configure XbusDma connextion


3.8 Linux & Symbian
	
	See dedicated release notes included in the respective package for more informations .


4	DEFECT STATUS

	Defects must be logged on VI:
		http://gnb500137.gnb.st.com/VIWebDev/default.asp
			/Dev/OS and Platform/Multimedia/COMMON/NMF/**
			_Support if category unknown


4.1	Fixed defect list

	21734	Change request: set default stack size to 8 KBytes in Think environment
	21365   Change request: Pmu api needed for initialization, start/stop of DSP timer (HTIMEN) from Pmu
	20938   Change request: Need new function in iLos to configure XbusDma connection
    22139   Think may crash on startup for 8500 targets if user doesn't use main arguments.

	- Issue in EE_CreateChannel when creating private channel.
	- Allow synchronous binding between ARM composite component
	

4.2	Active defect list

	22408	Resetting/stopping mmdsp core on mop500 stop mtu timers
	21851   Asynchronously bound composite component : trace contains corrupted 'this' addresses
	20810   "#pragma interface" is not set automatically by the nmf toolset when calling a method in a referenced interface
	20440   No way to compile some files with specific options



5	COMPILATION RULES

5.1	Compilation procedure & options

	Compilation options is fully based on MMENV.
	

5.2	Compilation configurability

	EXPORT_SHARED: can be re-defined for exporting API in a specific manner
	IMPORT_SHARED: can be re-defined for importing API in a specific manner
	
	For Think dynamic configuration, see doxygen documentation (think/doc/nmfthink/index.html).

	
5.3 Installation

	Automatic installation using mmtools
		update your components file with the correct package versions
		mmtools extract
	Manual installation
		* untar mmenv package into any location: <MMENV>
			tar xzvf mmenv-x.y.z.tgz
		* set MMENV_PATH environment variable to point to the mmenv location
			setenv MMENV_PATH <MMENV>
		* see mmenv documentation on how to set the target platform
			e.g. PLATFORM=ndk15b06-think 
		* create a NMF directory 
			mkdir <NMF_ROOT>
