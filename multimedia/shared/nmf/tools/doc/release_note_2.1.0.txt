    - LOS


3.1 Component Manager

	- The MPC component network could be trace during construction and dump when required.
		Today dump is partial since we dump only component not binding.
		Use CM_SetMode(CM_CMD_MPC_TRACE_ON)
		
	- Add CM_BindComponentTrace API in order to trace through XTI/STM each call on this interface on DSP.
		-> These traces is exploited by tool profile.
		
	- Check that loaded component have been compile with the right NMF version.
		-> Error if major.minnor version differ.
		-> Warning if not only patch version differ.
		
	- Deprecated API CM_BindComponentToHost & CM_BindComponentFromHost have been removed.
		-> User CM_BindComponentToUser & CM_BindComponentFromUser instead.
	
	- Add CM_FlushChannel() API. This API allow to send a CM_FLUSH_MESSAGE error to CM_GetMessage(), this
	  allow user to avoid to use a channel whereas it destroy it using CM_CloseChannel().

	- Add CM_GetComponentMemoryInfo() API. This API allows to calculate
	  component memory usage (on first instantiate, and on the following
	  ones). The implementation is on the user-side.
	  
	- CM_RegisterVirtualInterrupt -> EE_RegisterVirtualInterrupt
		Either if not clean, stay in CM for simplicity reason!!!
	

3.2 MPC Execution Engine

	- Homogenize MPC & Host STM trace format

	- Basic Ultra Low Power implementation (rely on Think implementation)
	
	- Add Synchronous trace in ADL for Host EE, like that:
		CM_BindComponentTrace(...) instead of CM_BindComponent()
	  Trace binding component used in this API must be generated through
	  	nmfitfc -trace <interface>


3.3 Host Execution Engine

	- Add STM trace in order to analyze execution engine scheduling activity through NMF tool profile.

	- Homogenize MPC & Host STM trace format
	
	- The ARM composite component network could be trace during construction and dump when required.
		Today dump is partial since the inter-composite binding is not trace.
		Note: Today API is not User, will be fixed later !
		
	- Add Synchronous trace in ADL for Host EE, like that:
		binds A.a to B.b trace

	- Dynamic execution thread creation priority by priority when launching composite
	
    - Add EE_FlushChannel() API. This API allow to send a EE_FLUSH_MESSAGE error to EE_GetMessage(), this
      allow user to avoid to use a channel whereas it destroy it using EE_CloseChannel().
      
    - Check that event FIFO was really empty when destroying it and that event was not currently queued in 
      execution engine scheduler.
    	-> If not Panic generated
    	
    - Trace on workstation is dump through stdout.

    
3.4 OS integration guidelines

	- OSAL_Write32 -> OSAL_Write64 in order to provide best bandwidth usage.
	
	- Host EE OSAL enhancement
		-> ee.api.configuration removed
		-> ee.api.priority added 
		
	- Add CM_BindComponentTrace API which imply an extra parameter on CM_OS/ENGINE_bindComponent:
		CM_ENGINE_BindComponent(...., t_bool traced);
	
	- Update CM_OS_GetRequiredComponentFiles() behaviors.
		Now, fileList & listSize parameters only fill for loading EE in CM_INTERNAL_Init.
		Elsewhere in each binding API, these parameters are NULL.
	
	- Implement CM_FlushChannel().
	
	- Implement EE_FlushChannel().

3.5 Tools

	- STM trace format has been update, please switch to new NMF tool profiler.
	
	- Update parser (IDL, ADL & CPP) in order to not interpret unicode \u character which break it.
	
	- Generate trace binding component through:
		nmfitfc -trace <interface>
		

3.6 Programming model

	- Add Synchronous trace in ADL for Host EE, like that:
		binds A.a to B.b trace

3.7 Think

	- 8815 XTI IP no more supported since not 64bits.
		-> CM, Host EE & DSP EE trace no more generated
		
	-  Variable cfgComponentRepositoryPath must be declared in user code in order to set 
	   NMF CM component repository path.
 	   Component repository path is directory separate by ";".
		
		char   cfgComponentRepositoryPath[] = "Path1;Path2;Path3";
	
	-  Basic Ultra Low Power implementation for ED (will be removed in V1)
	
	-  Add ILOS_CleanDestroyedJob()
