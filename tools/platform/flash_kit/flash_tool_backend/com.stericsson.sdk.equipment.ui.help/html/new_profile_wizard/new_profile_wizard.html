<h1>Profile General Settings Wizard</h1>
<p>Different MEs may have different configurations, both in terms of hardware and software. A profile is a text file containing the following information
for a certain ME configuration:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Profile Name - specifies the name of the profile</li>
	<li>Platform Filter - defines for which ME's platform this profile is intended, e.g. U8500</li>
	<li>Software Type and Path - the type of software and path to it. This software is used for communication between Flash Kit and ME, e.g. loader.</li>
	<li>Properties - specifies common properties like "Uses loader communication", "Boot indication", etc. These properties define behavior of the ME in connection to Flash Kit</li>
	<li>Security Properties - consist of list of security properties which can be set up in ME, e.g. IMEI, Control Keys.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>Required Fields:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Name: Profile name</li>
	<li>Platform: Select one of platform filters</li>
	<li>Type: Select one of software types</li>
	<li>Boot image: Path to file of selected software type</li>

</ul>

<h2>Properties Settings</h2>
<p>The second page of New Profile Wizard enables to set different properties which will be stored in profile file.
Security and common properties can be specified.</p>
<p>Common properties can be set up on the upper part of this page. Only those checkbox-style properties, 
which are set to true, will be exported to newly created profile file. All other properties are exported automatically.</p>
<p>The lower part of this page provides UI for creating a list of security properties which can be set on the ME of specified platform 
(of this platform, for which this profile is being created). It is necessary to define ID and Name of such security property, and possibly 
also place thick whether this property should be readable and/or writable.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The last page of this wizard shows the content of newly created profile file. This is the last step when it is possible to return
to previous pages and repair the entered data. When "Finish" is pressed, the profile file with specified name is created in the defined path.</p>
