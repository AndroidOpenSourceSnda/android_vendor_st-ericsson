This directory contains boot files for Snowball development boards,
commercial devices.

All .ssw files are signed software and should be used during flash with
Riff or similar tools.

All binaries except ISSW are copied from Android official build
u8500-android-2.3_v4.5 and signed for Snowball.

The source code for ISSW is of the same version as in the official build
but compiled for Snowball target instead.
