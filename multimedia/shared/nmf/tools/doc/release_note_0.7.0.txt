 		User guide not fully in line with delivery

Supported target:
	- Stn8810 SAA
	- STn8815 SAA & SVA

Changes:
--------
- [Tools] inclusion of ".h" and usage of C defined types no more allowed in interface declaration language.
- [Tools] Allow recognition of Memory qualifier on pointer & allow definition of array type in typedef 
- [Tools] Added option OVERWRITTEN_CFLAGS support (today for internal use only)
- [Tools] Updated to be compliant with new CM and EE file trees
- [Tools] Updated skels/stubs generators to be compliant with new communication scheme
- [Tools] Adding support to new constructor interface type (controller.constructor -> lifecycle.constructor)
- [Tools/EE] Constructor interface exports construct method (instead of init) 
- [Tools] Trace visualizer debug tool available from codex as Eclipse Update site
	https://codex.cro.st.com/plugins/docman/?group_id=598&action=show&id=4072
	
- [CM] new communication scheme
- [CM] new file tree (clear separation of userfifo from internal NMF fifo, saa vs sva factorization through semaphore virtual layer)
- [CM] start of code cleaning
- [CM] Added internal memory allocation error checking and propagation
- [CM] Added error disassembling service (error/inc/error.h) 
- [CM] new CM API (a sed script has been developped internally and can be provided as this):
         + Added CM_BindComponentToVoid() API routine (used to bind a given interface of a given component to a void component (trash-like)
         + API cleaning:
                - t_comp_instance_handle -> t_cm_instance_handle
                - t_interface_reference -> t_cm_interface_desc
                - t_dsp_id -> t_nmf_core_id (ARM_CORE -> ARM_CORE_ID, SVA_DSP -> SVA_CORE_ID, SAA_DSP -> SAA_CORE_ID)
                - CM_UnConnectXXX() -> CM_DisconnectXX() (Warning: CM_DisconnectHostAsFifoPusher/Poper take now two new parameters (those given for CM_ConnectXXX)
                - CM_CreateFifo() takes now t_nmf_core_id instead of t_dsp_id
                - t_cm_dsp_memory_type has been updated to discriminate 16-bit and 24-bit DSP memory spaces
                - CM_Init() API has been updated (merging of hw mapping and adding cm configuration (today size of SDRAM pgm and data segments)
                - t_nk_trace_desc -> t_cm_trace_desc
                - t_nk_osal_desc -> t_cm_osal_desc
         + Added NMFCALL/NMFMETH macros to ease Host2Dsp interface call and Dsp2Host callback declaration
- [CM] Unbind and destroy component implemented

- [EE] new communication scheme
- [EE] new file tree (saa vs sva factorization through semaphore virtual layer)
- [EE] Updated to support constructor interface renaming (type (controller -> lifecycle) AND method (init -> construct)

- [Examples] Examples common makefiles have been updated to support absolute pathes to override NMF_DELIVERY_PATH, NMF_EXAMPLEs_PATH and/or MPU_OSI_PATH
- [Examples] Examples common makefiles have been updated to support STn8810
- [Examples] Examples common makefiles have been updated to provide automatic current configuration display
- [Examples] Added Error disassembling service use
- [Examples] Updated to use of NMFCALL/NMFMETH macros  

Bug fixes:
----------
- [Tools] Defects correction: #19336, #19789, #19947, #20024, #20175, #20202, #20874, #20916, #21144, #22287 
- [Tools] Corrected internal defect: incorrect dependency computation 
- [Tools] Corrected internal defect: erroneous enum typedef name reference into generated binding components

- [CM] Defects correction: #20030, #20069, #20080, #20092, #20563

Notes:
------
	- MMDSP debugger not component aware in MMDSP toolset 3.0.x

	- Synchronous & Hybrid execution engines
		Priority mechanism not fully tested and allowed only in composite 
		component not though Component manager API (will be available in M2 Milestone)
	- Inter-DSP distribution not supported due to hardware limitation
		Will be fixed in STn8815B0
	- Only the 24bits mode supported on DSP
	- No cross calling between ESRAM and SDRAM Code
		A component code must fit in one segment only
		
	- Safe reconfiguration will be available in M2 Milestone
	    User must check itself network activity before reconfigure it
	- Memory allocator don't manage alignement 
		Must be done manually (alignement will be available in M2 Milestone)
		
	- MP3 example
		This example reuse CSD algorithm and must not been distribute outside ST Microelectonics

Pre-requires:
-------------
	- At least MMDSP toolset 3.0.3 must be used (http://gnx1227.gnb.st.com:8080/releases/release_list.php)
		MMDSP debugger not component aware
	- Java Runtime Environment  (http://java.sun.com/)
		At least JRE 1.5 
		(also installed by the MMDSP toolset 3.x)
		(also available for downloading on https://codex.cro.st.com/projects/nomadikkernel/)
   	- Gnu tools, 
		* On Linux, installed by default
		* On Windows, you must install either:
			+ CygWin
			+ MinGW/MSYS (http://www.mingw.org)
				MSYS-1.0.10.exe (at least)
				MinGW-4.1.0.exe (at least)
				(also available for downloading on https://codex.cro.st.com/projects/nomadikkernel/)
        

Test environment on NDK15:
--------------------------
	- Environments:
		DSP: SAA & SVA
			* For NVK10 platform, ESRAM data are mapped to SDRAM segments as no ESRAM on 8810
		Execution Engine: Synchronous, Hybrid
	- Tests:
		* Dynamic loading: 
			segment loading
				Mono-instance
				Multi-instances on same DSP
				Multi-instances on both DSP
			error management
		* Communication: 
			synchronous intra-DSP
			asynchronous intra-DSP
			ARM -> DSP
			DSP -> ARM
			error management
		* Memory 
			Alloc and free
		* Misc
			Attributes and properties
	- Test report available in Codex download files
