<h1>Default Data Wizard</h1>
<p>Default Data is a wizard for reading, writing, consistency
checking, and merging 19062, GDF, and GDVAR files used in the production
process.</p>
<h2>Pre-requisites</h2>
<p>Please make sure that you have an 19062 Excel Input File.</p>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Open the Default Data Sheet Tool Wizard by completing the
following steps:</p>
<ul>
	<li>In the Eclipse menu, select File -&gt; New &gt; Other... (or
	press Ctrl+N)</li>

<img src="../../images/default_data_wizard.png" />
<p>Required Fields:</p>
<ul>
	<li>File: A valid 19062 input file.</li>
	<li>Platform: Have to select one/all platform/s.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
</p>
<ul>
	<p>It is possible to work with a particular platform or to include
	all platforms that are specified by the 19062 file. The drop-down list
	box contains all platforms specified in the selected 19062 file. When
	the tool is first started, the drop-down list box is empty until a
	19062 file has been selected. To perform action(s) on all platforms
	specified in the 19062, select All. Note: When selecting all platforms,
	output files are placed in a sub-directory for each platform.
	Sub-directories are created (if necessary) and named by the platform.
	The Detailed report option is not available when selecting all
	platforms.</p>
</ul>

<p>
<h3>Consistency Check</h3>
</p>
<ul>
	<p>This action checks the consistency of the default data for the
	selected platform(s). The consistency check involves checking that the
	default data is valid and that it confirms to the ranges given in the
	19062 file specified in the 19062 Excel file field.</p>
</ul>

<p>
<h2>Create Output Files</h2>
</p>
<p>One or many output files can be created in one action. Simply
choose which files to create and then click Finish.</p>

<p>

<p>
<h3>Create GDVAR File</h3>
</p>
<ul>
	<p>Check this box to create a GDVAR file, using the path specified
	in the adjacent field. Use the "Browse" button to browse for another path or
	filename than the suggested.</p>
</ul>

<p>
<h3>Create GDF File</h3>
</p>
<ul>
	<p>Check this box to create a GDF file, using the path specified in
	the adjacent field. Use the "Browse" button to browse for another path or
	filename than the suggested.</p>
</ul>

<p>
<h3>Merge GDF with Input GDF File</h3>
</p>
<ul>
	<p>Check this box to merge the contents of an existing GDF file
	when creating a new GDF file. This alternative is only available if
	Create GDF file is already selected. The adjacent field is used to
	specify the input GDF file to use for the merge. Use the "Browse" button to
	browse for the input file. If the same ID number is found in the 19062
	file and the input GDF file, the 19062 data has precedence.</p>
</ul>

<p>
<h3>Create EE File</h3>
</p>
<ul>
	<p>Check this box to create an Early Configuration (EE) file, using
	the path specified in the adjacent field. Use the "Browse" button to browse
	for another path or filename than the suggested one.</p>
</ul>

<p>
<h3>Create EEVAR File</h3>
</p>
<ul>
	<p>Check this box to create an Early Configuration h (EEVAR) file,
	using the path specified in the adjacent field. Use the "Browse" button to
	browse for another path or filename than the suggested one. Create
	Product 19062 Excel File Check this box to create a customized version
	of the 19062 input file, using the path specified in the adjacent
	field. Use the "Browse" button to browse for another path or filename than
	the suggested. The differences between the input file and the
	customized version are the following:
	<ul>
		<li>The Module MKRR column is renamed N/A and does not contain
		any data.</li>
		<li>Only the Document Data and Default Data sheets are copied.</li>
		<li>Only the selected platform appears in the new document.</li>
		<li>Only rows with a Y in the Customize or Calibrate columns are
		copied.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
</ul>

<p>
<h3>Finish</h3>
</p>
<ul>
	<p>This action creates the output files in accordance to the
	selections above. Before any output file is produced, a consistency
	check is performed to ensure that the 19062 file, specified in the
	19062 Excel file field, is valid. If one of the output files to be
	produced already exists, it has to be decided whether or not to replace
	the existing file; if "No", the specific file is not created, but the
	rest of the action continues. If generation of GDF file(s) is selected,
	it has to be decided if calibration data is to be included in the
	generated GDF file. When processing of all platforms is selected, this
	question is only asked once and the answer is then applied to all
	platforms. The generated file uses Windows-style line ending. This
	means that the line ending consists of CR (Carriage Return, 0x0D)
	followed by LF (Line Feed, 0x0A).</p>
</ul>

<p>
<h3>Show Detailed Report when Finished</h3>
</p>
<ul>
	<p>Check this box to have eclipse to open a report containing
	information on the results of the actions. Note: This option is not
	available when processing all platforms at once.</p>
</ul>
