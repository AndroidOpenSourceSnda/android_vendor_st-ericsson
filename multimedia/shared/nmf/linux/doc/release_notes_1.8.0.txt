Supported target:
    - STn8820
    
Changes:
--------
[CM]
     For general changes (such as CM API update, etc), see the release notes under
     doc/nmf

[NMF Linux]
     * Add locking support in the OSAL for the CM User Proxy.
     * The CM User Proxy library has been updated due to CM API changes
       (again, see NMF release notes for detailes)
     * The LOS has been updated (The unsupported API LOS_NmfGetPowerStatus() has been
       definitively removed)
     * Add support to transfer the panic messages from MPC to the user proxy.
     * Now the Proxy/driver uses two devices:
       - /dev/cm0 for all control commands (Most of the CM API are passed through this channel)
       - /dev/cm1 is used only for callback channels.

Bug fixes:
---------
[NMF Linux]
