**************************************************
* Linux Environment (version 1.4.0)              *
**************************************************

The release comprises one .tgz file holding the following features:
    - The needed files to develop NMF applications under Linux:
      (libraries and header)
    - The binaries to run NMF applications on the target.

Source codes can be found in Codex SVN site:

    Revision 230

Supported target:
    - STn8815
    - STn8820
    
Changes:
--------
[NMF Linux]
     * Update with the new Component Cache System
       - Provide required OSAL in CM User Proxy
       - Provide required SYSCALL wrappers
     * Update with the new CM API that allows the user to handle the callback himself
       (See VI ID 20536)
       - Provide required OS wrappers
       - Update the CM Driver to support this API
     * Consequently, the cmsyscallwrapper.h header is no more needed and thus no more provided:
       - The cup_ProxyInit() API is replaced by CM_UserInit()
       - The cup_HandleNextEvent() API is replaced by CM_GetMessage()
     * LOS API has been fully implemented (but not all API are supported because of OS
     specific restrictions)
     * Disable start/stop of STM traces on nkd20 boards

Bug fixes:
---------
[NMF Linux]
     * Fix init and destroy of the CM Driver module on ndk20
     * Fix minor delivery issues related to mmtools integration
     * Fix OSAL_SemaphoreWaitTimed() which never returned before end of time-out value,
       implying performance issue.
     * Fix EE component handles were not registered in driver's components list:
       => handler returned by CM_GetExecutiveEngineHandle() was unusable by the caller.
     * Fix CM_GetComponentRequiredInterfaceBinding() returned CM_ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE
       because of internal binding components not registered by the driver.
     * Fix several instantiation of 'singleton' components let the driver return different
       component handle for each 'instantiate' instead of the same handle.
     * Other minor bug fixes and cleanup.

Notes
-----
- On 8820, STM traces are not started.

Known Issues:
-------------
- XTI and STM traces not tested.

Pre-requires:
-------------
    - Kernel linux 2.6.24_stm23_0022 derived from STLinux 2.3 distribution
      (package stlinux23-arm-kernel) with the kernel config, as provided by
      Nomadik Multimedia Linux (see codex project 'mmdlinux' and its svn tree
      under module linux_kernel: the easiest way to access this environment
      is to use mmtools)
    - GCC ARM compiler 4.2.1 from STLinux 2.3 distribution
    - The tools are provided in a separate package:
      nmf_tools package is required to develop NMF application.
