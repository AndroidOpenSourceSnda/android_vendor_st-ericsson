3   RELEASE CONTENT

    See tools/doc/file_hierarchies.txt about file tree organization !

    - Toolbox

    - Component Manager

    - Execution Engine

    - Think

    - LOS


3.1 Component Manager
    
    - Add OSAL_Panic API.
    
    - Remove SAA_CORE_ID from API.
        -> Be careful to use MACRO instead of value.
        
    - Changed t_cm_domain_id from 32bit to 8bit 

    - VI#27258 - allow 64kb alignment in CM_ENGINE_AllocMpcMemory()
    
    
3.2 MPC Execution Engine

    - Remove sub priority
    
    - Remove malloc helper
    

3.3 Host Execution Engine

    - Add sub priority implementation inside scheduler
        Sub-priority can be set like that:
            In ADL
                binds ... to ... asynchronous fifo=... subpriority=x 
                Where x = {0..3}
            In Composite API
                bindFromUser(..., x);       // x == 0 if not setted
                binAsycnhronous(..., x);    // x == 0 if not setted

    - Add Composite::getMPCComponentHandle("name") in order to get a CM component handle
      deploy on MPC through a ARM composite component.
        This method allow you to get a component instance of a component instantiate automatically by
        this composite. This reference could be used to create sub-binding (like tunneling) with other MPC
        components (either obtain by this method on other composite or directly instantiate using
        Component Manager.
        Note: Potential created sub-binding must be unbound before destroying the composite!
        
    - Ability to set dynamically component priority through:
        * In ADL:
            contains A as a priority=mypriority
        * In C++:
             MyComposite* C = createMyComposite();
             C->mypriority = <INTEGER_PRIORITY>;
       FIX 26751 Need possibility to set the priority level of one component when component is created

    - Take into account primitive component extending type
       FIX 24428 auto-generated wrapper component does not consider extended components
           
    - Add io priority for component that want to do blocking call (like FS read). To use it, add:
        * In ADL:
            contains A as a priority=io
        * This feature must be used with care:
            + Only 4 thread started to handle component execution
            + Priority is not ordering with other component priority and depend on OS integration    
    
    - Error recovery
        Clearly destroy objects that has been created during construct either if this one failed.
        
    - Add getProperty on Composite interface.
        t_nmf_error getProperty(
            const char              *name,
            char                    *value,
            t_uint32                valuelen
            );
    
    *** Deprecated; will be removed in next version ***
        - ADL syntax has been enhance for supporting dynamic priority setting:
            * Removed:
                contains A as a <INTEGER_PRIORITY>
            * Replaced by:
                contains A as a priority=<INTEGER_PRIORITY>


3.4 OS integration guidelines

    - Add OSAL_Panic() API which should trigger a kernel-panic.
    
    - For hostee. When os failed to create a worker thread then os integrator no longer need
      to kill already created thread. These threads will exit gracefully. For that os
      integrator has to do following modification :
       - notifyStart() os implementation now return a t_sint32
       - in case of success, there is no change. Return number of worker thread created (so not
         take into account distribution thread created)
       - in case of error return a negative number that indicate number of thread already
         created before error. This time this number MUST include distribution thread.
       - in your implementation you MUST create distribution thread first and then worker thread.

    - Component dynamic loading optimization
        - Add OSAL_CleanDCache(startAddr, endAddr) to clean data cache range (invalidate not required)    
        - MMDSP DDR Code segment could be declared as WB memory
        
    - For HostEE another priority has been added (io, which is level 6).
        - Either if HostEE priority is greater, OS thread priority has to be decided according OS and 
            don't need to be greater nor ordered.
        - By default, launch 4 threads, could be reconfigure later according user requirement.  

	- CM_ENGINE_CreateMemoryDomain() takes one more parameter:
		- First arg is  't_nmf_client_id' (unsigned int). It must be used to identify
		a user client.
		- 0 is an invalid client ID
		- For domains not belonging to a user client, you can use NMF_CORE_CLIENT.

	- CM_ENGINE_FlushComponent() is removed and replaced by CM_ENGINE_FlushComponents()
	   and CM_ENGINE_FlushMemoryDomains():
	   The OS integrator can call them to destroy all components and domains that belongs
	   to a client.


3.5 Tools
      

3.6 Programming model

    - Singleton instance template was no more shared between several instantiation.
        This allow NMF to check that a singleton in correctly configured inside each instantiation
        and that your code don't fall in work thank to another scenario that configure it for you.
        -> CHECK YOUR CODE if "NOT BINDED" error appear for singleton during regression


3.7 Think
    
    - correct unaligned access when using atoi(), strtoul() and other same family functions (vi 27557)
