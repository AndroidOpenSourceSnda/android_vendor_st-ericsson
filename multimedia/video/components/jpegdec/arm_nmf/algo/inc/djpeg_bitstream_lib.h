 * On most machines MIN_GET_BITS should be 25 to allow the full 32-bit width
 * of get_buffer to be used.  (On machines with wider words, an even larger
 * buffer could be used.)  However, on some machines 32-bit shifts are
 * quite slow and take time proportional to the number of places shifted.
 * (This is true with most PC compilers, for instance.)  In this case it may
 * be a win to set MIN_GET_BITS to the minimum value of 15.  This reduces the
 * average shift distance at the cost of more calls to jpeg_fill_bit_buffer.
