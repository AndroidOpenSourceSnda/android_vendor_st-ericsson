    - Toolbox

    - Component Manager

    - Execution Engine


3.1 Component Manager
    
    - ECR (VI 28186): By default, STM trace is disabled, to enable them use:
        CM_SetMode(CM_CMD_TRACE_ON, <core Id>)
        This command will also send a reset to NMF profiling tools and flush the network.
    
    - Video ECR: Support for scratch domains:
        CM_CreateMemoryDomainScratch()
        This API creates a scratch domain for esram data (it can contain other memories).
        A scratch zone is the physical memory covered by scratch domains.
        
        Memory in a scratch zone can be allocated concurrently to several scratch domains.
        
        The API expects a parent domain (parentId) which will determine the boundaries of the
        scratch zone, any child scratch domain must be within these boundaries. It may be smaller.
        Several scratch domains can be created over the same zone. For each such domain, a virtual
        allocator is created for the scratch zone. Scratch domains overlap and so do the allocations
        between these domains! It is up to the user to use the allocated memory carefully, ie 
        no persistent data must be stored in the scratch domain, so only one-shot data, like
        buffers may be in the scratch. This works as the nmf model is run-to-completion. However,
        special case must be taken to ensure that all components using the same scratch zone
        run at the same priority!         
    
    - MMTE ECR: Add CM_GetMemoryStatusEx() replacing CM_GetMemoryStatus() domainId by coreId.
        New API required due to deprecation of CM_GetDefaultDomain.
    
    - ** DEPRECATED (Will be removed in 2.7) ** 
        CM_GetDefaultDomain()
        CM_GetMemoryStatus()

    - VI 28355 Fix a kernel panic that occurs in some corner cases when processing
      MPC Events 


3.2 MPC Execution Engine

    - ECR (VI 28186): By default, STM trace is disabled, to enable them use:
        CM_SetMode(CM_CMD_MPC_TRACE_ON, <core Id>)

    - Audio ECR: Interrupt handler & IT11 locked in cache

    - Audio ECR: Allow component to declare code to be locked in cache
        -> Don't use this feature without global synchronization with architect !!!!!!!
        -> Require MMDSP toolset 4.3.0 Patch 4
        
    
3.3 Host Execution Engine

    - Fix warning in generated code
    
    - Remove deprecated EE_TrigInterrupt API
        -> Use IO priority if need synchronous way on kernel drivers.
        
    - Audio ECR: Enhance ARM composite API in order to allow bind with MMDSP component deploy through CM API:
        bindFromMPC
        unbindFromMPC
        bindToMPC
        unbindToMPC
        
    - bindAsychronous Allow MPC tunneling binding without involving ARM side 
    
    - ECR (VI 28186): By default, STM trace is disabled, to enable them use:
        EE_SetMode(EE_CMD_TRACE_ON, 0)
        This command will also send a reset to NMF profiling tools and flush the network.

    - ** DEPRECATED (Will be removed in 2.7) ** 
        Since CM_GetDefaultDomain is deprecated, such syntax in ADL is also deprecated:
            contains A as a SIA
            contains A as a SVA
        You have to pass explicitly the domain created by yourself or RME, like that:
            contains A as a domainX
            
            Composite->domainX = ...; // Assigned before calling Composite->construct();
        

3.4 OS integration guidelines

    - Remove deprecated EE_OS_RegisterInterrupt API
    
    - Changed CM_OS_GetMemoryStatus() (domainId -> coreId)
 
    - Added scratch domain API:
            CM_OS_CreateMemoryDomainScratch()
            
    - OSAL_Alloc must log an error if returning NULL, in order to ease debug and support.
