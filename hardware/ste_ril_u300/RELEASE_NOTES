SUMMARY
  The U300 RIL has been updated to support Android Eclair. This includes new 
  functionality that was missing in the Donut version of the U300 RIL.

NEW FUNCTIONALITY ADDED
  - Neighbouring cell information (RIL_REQUEST_NEIGHBORINGCELL_IDS)
  - CAIF socket and Linux socket for communicating with the AT subsystem. 
  - TTY support (RIL_REQUEST_SET_TTY_MODE, RIL_REQUEST_QUERY_TTY_MODE).
  - Report SMS memory status to the modem (RIL_REQUEST_REPORT_SMS_MEMORY_STATUS)
  - Enable STK service in the modem (RIL_REQUEST_REPORT_STK_SERVICE_IS_RUNNING)
  - Signal strength reporting (RIL_UNSOL_SIGNAL_STRENGTH)
  - Signal strength reporting is turned off during power save (screen off).
  - Report SIM SMS storage full (RIL_UNSOL_SIM_SMS_STORAGE_FULL)
  - Play outband ring tone (RIL_UNSOL_RINGBACK_TONE)

RIL COMMANDS NOT FULLY SUPPORTED
  - RIL_REQUEST_SMS_ACKNOWLEDGE
    A work-around solution is implemented. The proper implementation should use
    AT+CNMA, which is currently being implemented for ST-Ericsson modems.

RIL COMMANDS NOT SUPPORTED
  - RIL_REQUEST_EXIT_EMERGENCY_CALLBACK_MODE
    RIL_UNSOL_ENTER_EMERGENCY_CALLBACK_MODE
    ST-Ericsson modems do not support Emergency Callback Mode. It does not
    exist in 3GPP. This seems to be Blackberry specific functionality command.
  - RIL_REQUEST_STK_HANDLE_CALL_SETUP_REQUESTED_FROM_SIM
    This is the response to RIL_UNSOL_STK_CALL_SETUP, which requires high level
    STK support below the RIL. The command is connected to the SET UP CALL proactive
    command.
  - RIL_REQUEST_SET_BAND_MODE
    RIL_REQUEST_QUERY_AVAILABLE_BAND_MODE
    The ST-Ericsson modem select band mode automatically. It is not possible to
    explicitly select band mode using AT commands.
  - RIL_REQUEST_CDMA_*
    RIL_UNSOL_CDMA_*
    All CDMA specific commands are not supported because ST-Ericsson modems
    do not support CDMA.
  - RIL_UNSOL_STK_EVENT_NOTIFY
    Android uses this unsolicited request to pass 5 proactive commands which
    are not fully handled in STK Telephony. Android expects these proactive
    commands to be handled below the vendor RIL. This is currently not
    supported in the ST-Ericsson modems.
  - RIL_UNSOL_STK_CALL_SETUP
    The command is used when the SIM wants to set up a voice call and asks for
    confirmation to proceed. The corresponding proactive command, SET UP CALL
    must be supported below the RIL. This is not supported in the Modem.
  - RIL_UNSOL_SIM_REFRESH
    RIL_UNSOL_SIM_REFRESH maps to the REFRESH proactive command. The difference
    is that the Android RIL command parameters are a subset of the REFRESH
    parameters. STK Telephony has support for both RIL_UNSOL_SIM_REFRESH and
    REFRESH received as a proactive command. REFRESH is thus supported as a
    proactive command.
  - RIL_UNSOL_RESTRICTED_STATE_CHANGED
    Block RIL commands due to restricted state in the RIL. The use case for
    this command is unclear -startup, shutdown, radio on/off, SIM refresh? The
    command is generated by the RIL. Execution path stops in the java code.

KNOWN BUGS
  - RIL_REQUEST_GSM_GET_BROADCAST_SMS_CONFIG and
    RIL_REQUEST_GSM_SET_BROADCAST_SMS_CONFIG does not work
