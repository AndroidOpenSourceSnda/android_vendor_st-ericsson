; These are example exception vectors and exception handlers
;
; Where there is ROM fixed at 0x0 (build_b), these are hard-coded at 0x0.
; Where ROM/RAM remapping occurs (build_c), these are copied from ROM to RAM.
; The copying is done automatically by the C library code inside __main.
;
; This version puts a branch to an Interrupt Handler (IRQ_Handler in int_handler.c) 
; in its exception vector table.

T_bit EQU 0x20

; Note: LDR PC instructions are used here, though branch (B) instructions
; could also be used, unless the ROM is at an address >32MB.
