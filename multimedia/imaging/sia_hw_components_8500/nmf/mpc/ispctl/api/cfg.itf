/**
 * performs one-time configuration of the component, pertaining to
 * physical sensor inputs in its control.
 * Althouth the ISP controls most of its hardware functions, it does not
 * control the mux that selects which input it recieves, nor does it have
 * the controls to configure CSI2 input settings. These controls are thus
 * in the ISPCTL component, which snoops page-elements to the ISP to
 * transparently set these inputs correctly. 
 * 
 * \param mapping a structure mapping the ISP's logical inputs (Sensor_0 
 * and Sensor_1) to the hardware's physical inputs
 * \param client_id, the index in the sia_rm.alert[] interface collection 
 * that this component is bound to
 * \param csi2Config parameters for the CSI2 input, To Be Determined
 *
 * \todo find specific CSI2 parameters that will be needed (will be finalized
 * in 8820 CutB)
