/**
 * A service user that has one or more PDP contexts or MBMS bearer services 
 * activated shall subscribe to this event by calling the function 
 * Request_EventChannel_Subscribe() with argument Event_Id set to 
 * EVENT_ID_PS_DATAPATHCONNECT_SENT. The service user shall also maintain a 
 * static local variable of type PROCESS for each PDP context / MBMS bearer service 
 * used by the service user. This variable identifies the current Service 
 * Handler for SDU transfer on the specified PDP context / MBMS bearer service
 * and shall be included as argument when calling Do_PS_UplinkSDU_Send_V2 and 
 * Do_PS_DownlinkSDU_Enable_V2. 
 *
 * Upon receiving this event, the service user shall call the 
 * correspondent event unpack function to extract the NSAPI parameter. 
 * If it matches the NSAPI parameter of a PDP context / MBMS bearer service
 * handled by the service user, the corresponding Service Handler variable 
 * shall be updated with the process identity extracted with said unpack 
 * function. Further, the downlink credit counter for the indicated 
 * PDP context shall be set to zero and any missing responses to 
 * previous calls to functions Do_PS_UplinkSDU_Send_V2 and 
 * Do_PS_DownlinkSDU_Enable_V2 for the indicated NSAPI shall be 
 * cancelled. The SDU transfer shall be continued by calling the 
 * uplink and the downlink functions, this time, of course, using the 
 * new value of the Service Handler variable. When the service user 
 * has deactivated all PDP contexts / MBMS bearer services, it 
 * should unsubscribe to this event.
