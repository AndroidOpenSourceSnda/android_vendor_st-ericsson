*****************************
* Nomadik Kernel 0.6.1      *
*****************************

The release comprises one .tgz file holding the following features:
	- Component manager binary & api
 	- Synchronous & Hybrid execution engine binaries
 	- Component tool chain binary
 	- Example source codes (Hello World, User Guide, MP3, User Fifo)
 	- Documentations (User guide, programming model, CM API, DSP API)

Supported target:
	- STn8815 SAA & SVA

Changes:
--------
- [Tools] NKDEBUG environment variable replace by NMF_DEBUG and possible value totally changed
- [Tools] (Requirement #19652) CFLAGS management
	option CFLAGS would allow to define OVERRIDABLE CFLAGS values
	option FIXED_CFLAGS would allow to define UNOVERRIDABLE CFLAGS value.
- [Tools] (Requirement #19701) Properties was declared in the C wrapper (.nk) as a macro for 
                               access them from DSP C source code
- [Examples] Examples makefiles have been updated to allow DSP, EE type and debug link selection (see examples/readme file)
- [CM] t_cm_error enumerate has been updated to provide more understandable errors
        discriminate binding component loading error from the "standard" component one
        discriminate CM_NO_SUCH_INTERFACE error between provided ones and required ones
- [EE] default stack size of both Executive Engine have been updated:
        synchronous EE: stack size = 4096 -> 512
        hybrid EE: stack size = 4096 -> 1536

Bug fixes:
----------
- (Defect #19558) Overriding the CFLAGS make variable from command line
- (Defect #19614) Corrected execution engine path pass to mmgdb in the dsp makefile
- (Defect #19723) no way to specify sources in the current directory in .conf file

Notes:
------
	- MMDSP debugger not component aware in MMDSP toolset 3.0.1

	- Synchronous & Hybrid execution engines
		Priority mechanism not fully tested and allowed only in composite 
		component not though Component manager API (will be available in M2 Milestone)
	- Inter-DSP distribution not supported due to hardware limitation
		Will be fixed in STn8815B0
	- Only the 24bits mode supported on DSP
	- No cross calling between ESRAM and SDRAM Code
		A component code must fit in one segment only
		
	- Unbind and destroy component not fully implemented (unsafe reconfiguration)
		Safe reconfiguration will be available in M2 Milestone
	- Memory allocator don't manage alignement 
		Must be done manually (alignement will be available in M2 Milestone)
		
	- Trace visualizer debug tool
		Not yet released (will be release in Engineering release)
		
	- MP3 example
		This example reuse CSD algorithm and must not been distribute outside ST Microelectonics

Pre-requires:
-------------
	- At least MMDSP toolset 3.0.1 must be used (http://gnx1227.gnb.st.com:8080/releases/release_list.php)
		MMDSP debugger not component aware
	- Java Runtime Environment  (http://java.sun.com/)
		At least JRE 1.5 
		(also installed by the MMDSP toolset 3.x)
		(also available for downloading on https://codex.cro.st.com/projects/nomadikkernel/)
   	- Gnu tools, 
		* On Linux, installed by default
		* On Windows, you must install either:
			+ CygWin
			+ MinGW/MSYS (http://www.mingw.org)
				MSYS-1.0.10.exe (at least)
				MinGW-4.1.0.exe (at least)

Test environment on NDK15:
--------------------------
	- Environments:
		DSP: SAA & SVA
		Execution Engine: Synchronous, Hybrid
	- Tests:
		* Dynamic loading: 
			segment loading
				Mono-instance
				Multi-instances on same DSP
				Multi-instances on both DSP
			error management
		* Communication: 
			synchronous intra-DSP
			asynchronous intra-DSP
			ARM -> DSP
			DSP -> ARM
			error management
