FmRadioTransmitter is a sample application that demonstrates the use of the
com.stericsson.fm.FmTransmitter class to implement a FM Radio transmitter in
an application. The application allows the user to scan the 88MHz-90MHz
frequency region for the channel with the least signal interference.
The application then transmits any audio using the FM Radio chip.

The suggested use is to start a long media file in the MediaPlayer application
then turn on the FmRadioTransmitter sample application.
