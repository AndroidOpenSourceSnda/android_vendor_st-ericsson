FmRadioReceiver is a sample application that demonstrates the use of the
com.stericsson.fm.FmReceiver class to implement a FM Radio receiver in an
application.

The application allows the user to tune to any local radio
stations, switch between them, scan for new stations and mute the radio.

It also allows the user to change the radio band to suit their location.
The use of listeners is shown to display the tuned station name if RDS data
is present.

The FmRadioReceiver.java file in FmRadioReceiver also illustrates the interaction with the MediaPlayer.
