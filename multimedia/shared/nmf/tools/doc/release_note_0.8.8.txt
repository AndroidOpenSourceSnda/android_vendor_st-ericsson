**********************************************************
* Nomadik Multiprocessing Framework (version 0.8.8)      *
**********************************************************

The release comprises one .tgz file holding the following features:
	- Component manager binary & api
 	- Synchronous & Hybrid execution engine binaries
 	- Component tool chain binary
 	- Example source codes (Hello World's, Training, Mandelbrot, User Fifo)
 		Hello world and mp3 Eclipse project delivered
 	- Documentations (User guide, programming model, CM API, MPC API)
 		User guide not fully in line with delivery
 
Sources are delivered in another .tgz.

Supported target:
	- STn8815 SAA & SVA Cut A0/B0/C0
	
Supported environments:
	- nmf_bare: based on Nomadik HCL/services libraries
	- nmf_ee: 	based on internal component-based OS
	- nmf_os21: based on ARM OS21

Changes:
--------
[CM]
	- Add start reference counter in order to really start(stop) on first(last) call to 
 	  CM_Start(stop)Component CM API.
 	- Add internal service for flushing destroyed component that have been acknowledge 
 	  by MPC, this service is called when instantiating a new component or getting 
 	  memory status. Nevertheless, since acknowledge can take time, it could be useful to
 	  wait a little before getting status.  
	 
[MPC Executive Engine]
	- Disable interrupt during xti access in order to not interleave trace.
	
[Execution Environment]
	- PATCH configuration type to don't fall in incompatibility between RVD and GCC on 2D array.
	- Add generated C host binding component for Symbian integration in delivery.
	- Fix compilation flags issue in order to provide compatibility between RVCT and GCC.
		Nevertheless, some issue will stay until HCL/Services compiled with correct flags.
	  
[Tools] 
	- Limit Tools resource consumptions when compiling
	- Use ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED to disable use of colors
 
[Programming model]


Bug fixes:
----------
 - Allow MMDSP elf section mem10 to be loaded
 - [Bug 187] Bad behavior of NMFCONF2C utility
 - Correct problem of same file present multiple times in source package
 - Correct problem of sign extension in pointer marshaling.
 - [ Defect #29910 ] [Tools] Method with pointer in returned type is not supported (IDL)
 - [ Defect #30157 ] [CM] no check on coreId of fifo pusher/poper in CM_CreateUserFifo
 		Add checks against pusherId and popperId
 - [ Defect #33625 ] [CM] erroneous memory status when doing CM_AddSdramMemorySegment
 		There was a table overflow due to a bad assertion check.
		Assertion has been remove and replace by a return of CM_OUT_OF_LIMITS error.
 - [ Defect #33695 ] [CM] CM_ConnectMpcAsFifoPoper: bind must not be done in case of error 
 				     on notify interface
 - [ Defect #33699 ] [Tools] Empty Prefix possible in a conf. file
		Check added.
 - [ Defect #33947 ] [CM] Bad return code whith interface name like "out[]" and incorrects 
 	                 warnings
 - [ Defect #33950 ] [CM] interface names not strict enough
 		Add checking
 - [ Defect #34112 ] Wrong binding can occur when interface name is too long
 - [ Defect #34218 ] [CM] CM_UNKNOWN_MEMORY_HANDLE not returned by CM_Free in case of invalid handle
 		Check null parameter.
 - [ Defect #34227 ] [CM] CM_UNKNOWN_MEMORY_HANDLE not returned by CM_GetSystemAddress in case of
   					 invalid handle
 - [ Defect #34234 ] [CM] CM_InstantiateComponent crashes if mpc memory is full
 - [ Defect #34251 ] [CM] CM_COMPONENT_NOT_UNBINDED: 'target' interface still binded
 
 
Notes:
------
    - Communication scheme uses active polling when overflow on communication fifos
			Active polling will be removed in next delivery

	- Synchronous & Hybrid execution engines
		Priority mechanism not fully tested 
	- Inter-MPC distribution not supported due to hardware limitation on STn8815A0
	- No cross calling between ESRAM and SDRAM Code
		A component code must fit in one memory segment only
		
	- MP3 example supported only on nmf_bare environment.
		This example reuse CSD algorithm and must not been distribute outside ST Microelectronics.
		Today, this example only runs on bare machine (due to APD HCL/Services packages issues).
	- Mandelbrot example supported only on nmf_bare and nmf_ee environment (not included in Nomadik
	 	Toolset delivery).
	- Some link issue with GNU toolchain could occur in examples until HCL/Services compiled with 
		correct flags.
