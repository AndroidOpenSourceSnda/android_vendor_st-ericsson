README FOR AUTOLOGCAT
---------------------


USAGE:
-----
During tests autologcat can be used to log to file on an SDcard even after several reboots. 
It is configured using a file with the logcat command to issue.

The configuration file with the logcat command to run is named "autologcat.conf".
Default configuration logs ADM server (audio) messages and nothing else to files on a mounted SDcard.


PREREQUISITS:
------------

BUILD:

Autologcat will only be built in engineering and development mode.


AUTOMATIC START AT BOOT:

In order for autologcat to log automatically it has to be started as a service, e.g. in init.rc.

An example addition to init.rc :

#STE: Android longterm autologging service : autologcat
service autologcat /system/bin/autologcat
    user root
    oneshot
